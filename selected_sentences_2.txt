This brings me to our current monetary policy stance

I now look forward to listening to your views during today’s debate

6% in October 2022, inflation has since declined significantly thanks to the unwinding of energy shocks and various supply-side disruptions along with determined policy action

A complete banking union would support more integrated banking services across the euro area and strengthen the global competitiveness of our banking sector

Completing Europe’s capital markets union (CMU) will also be key in financing the twin transition

[22]  Fourth, we would implement state-of-the-art security and privacy-preserving measures to ensure privacy protection

First, we already provide cash, the payment instrument that offers the highest level of privacy

While use of and preferences for cash payments are on a declining trend, the importance of cash remains high

As clearly stated in the European Commission’s legislative proposal, preserving the role of central bank money should not come at the expense of other objectives, such as protecting monetary policy transmission or financial stability

This limit will be set to preserve financial stability, having considered the impact on different bank business models and on monetary policy transmission and implementation

Ensuring the stability of the financial system  There is a growing public preference for digital payments

See Panetta, F

This is particularly crucial for components that are not yet on the market, such as the offline digital euro functionality

Selected Sentences:
Our policy measures are making a substantial contribution to reducing inflation, demonstrating our commitment to ensuring that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner

At the same time, some forward-looking survey indicators point to a pick-up in growth further ahead

Structural reforms and investments that improve the euro area’s supply capacity – which would be supported by the full implementation of the Next Generation EU programme – can help to reduce price pressures in the medium term, while supporting the green and digital transitions

As we celebrate ten years of banking union, we have to recognise that it is still incomplete

Profit margins could also prove more resilient than anticipated

This means that the disinflationary process is continuing

Higher interest rates in particular weigh on the debt servicing capacity of highly indebted corporates

Looking at the euro area inflation forecast errors, we have observed two things

Potential output is determined by three main factors

Economic outlook and monetary policy  Our interest rate decisions are guided by three considerations: first, the inflation outlook in light of incoming economic and financial data; second, the dynamics of underlying inflation; and third, the transmission of our monetary policy to financing conditions and the real economy

, “Assessment of the European Central Bank’s Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process”

But there is no reason for complacency

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023),  Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank , April, p

Do we, at the ECB, possess the necessary powers, ability and, crucially, the willingness to act in banking supervision? The short answer is an unequivocal yes

But can we give banks the right incentives to remedy the deficiencies we identify? Do we have the powers to get banks to do things they don’t want to do?  Let me emphasise that we do not come to the task empty handed

Such outcomes play a crucial role in refining the legal landscape and bring about a clearer understanding of the law

But despite supervisory efforts, too many banks still don’t have adequate risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities

The reports unanimously confirm that ECB Banking Supervision has successfully established itself as an effective supervisor

And we are increasingly focused on taking action to get banks to remedy deficiencies that have so far remained unaddressed

And then a third element, according to the treaties – again, I’m always going back to the treaties – is that what can be done at the national level should be done at the national level

And those measures, all in all, have been equivalent to more than three times the total profits that were paid out by European banks in the last year before the pandemic

This pandemic will probably be a little bit longer with us than had been foreseen

Why transfer onto the European level problems that originate at the national level? Once we have not only a single supervisor, but also a common deposit insurance scheme, a common resolution scheme, and a capital markets union, an asset management company for cross-border banks' assets would also make sense

There were many occasions during the crisis where the ECB found itself in truly uncharted waters

This construct has been largely successful: incomes across the continent have materially increased, integration and value chains have developed to an extent unimaginable 20 years ago, and the Single Market has survived intact through the worst crisis since the 1930s

You can look back with satisfaction on what you achieved in extremely testing conditions, and in the knowledge that you have improved the welfare of many people

Monetary policy can still achieve its objective, but it can do so faster and with fewer side effects if fiscal policies are aligned with it

This is why we need a euro area fiscal capacity of adequate size and design: large enough to stabilise the monetary union, but designed not to create excessive moral hazard

I am confident that it will continue to do so, because it is ultimately the self-interest of individual countries that lays out our future path towards a European sovereign

In our case, the ECB has proven that it will not accept threats to monetary stability caused by unfounded fears about the future of the euro

[2]  The second lesson concerns the institutional construction of EMU

Under pressure of events, some answers to these three types of problems were found with the creation of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the Banking Union, a project still incomplete

[5]  Monetary union design Aside from a single currency and a fiscal brake, the initial EMU’s architecture was minimalist: the governance of economic and financial policies firmly remained a national competence and there was no fiscal policy at the European level, no crisis management mechanisms of financial assistance to States and no European financial supervision

A significant part of that lending was under the form of Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA), which is implemented by national central banks that also incur the respective credit risk but require a non-objection from the ECB Governing Council, from the perspective of monetary policy objectives

To that end, Europe needs to boost the supply of equity finance

Together, these experts have developed an impressive number of handbooks, guidelines and procedures, models for economic analysis, statistical systems and new primary or secondary legislative acts; this whole framework has helped the National Bank of Serbia take an important step forward towards implementing EU central banking standards

This also has implications for EU candidate countries and potential candidates in the Western Balkans, including Serbia, given the role of banks headquartered in the euro area in the banking sectors of the region

The programme we are closing today has been the ECB’s most complex and ambitious programme to date

This work has now too been fully completed and we are ready to close the programme

In addition, the EU continues to update rules, regulations and best practices, which means that the target is always moving

While the challenges are obviously not identical, these same issues are also relevant for Serbia

It has covered 13 different central banking areas and has been implemented in partnership with 21 national central banks from the European System of Central Banks

The establishment of the SSM implies that for many foreign-owned banks operating in Serbia, the ECB will become the “home” supervisor and they will no longer be supervised by different national supervisors depending on where they have their headquarters

We cannot, however, address by ourselves the underlying root causes of the problems that relate to fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances, a lack of competitiveness, low growth and high unemployment

More than 170 experts from EU central banks have been providing input and guidance to their Serbian colleagues and around 150 Serbian colleagues have been visiting their EU counterparts to get hands-on exposure to systems and procedures used by them in their respective central banks


Speaker: José Manuel González-Páramo
Selected Sentences:
And third, since 2009, and particularly since last autumn, European governments have acted individually and collectively to establish or strengthen the pillars of a stable and durable euro

Admittedly, the vulnerabilities created by excessively large current account deficits are greater than those associated with surpluses, and therefore require more urgent remedies

If we add to these important developments the possibility of recapitalising banks through the ESM in the case of countries not subject to a programme, we could speak of the first significant steps towards a euro area regime

2 Management and resolution of crises Despite all this progress, which undoubtedly represents a qualitative leap in the governance of the euro, it would be naive to believe that crises will be relegated to history only because we will always manage to avert them at an early stage

)

However, the decisions must be explained, the approval procedures followed and sometimes political compromises have to be negotiated, and all within a system of 17 sovereign democracies

This approach to the completion of the euro project should focus on four key pillars of stability: economic governance, crisis management, financial regulation and supervision, and monetary policy

A second example comes from the practical implementation of policy decisions taken in response to the crisis

The absence of these kind of federal institutions in Europe is a source of vulnerability

Markets expect decisions that have an immediate effect, decisions that are bold, front-loaded and far-reaching


Speaker: Lorenzo Bini Smaghi
Selected Sentences:
Therefore, fundamentals are often over- or underestimated depending on the country and the point in time

Imbalances are, thus, financed for too long and at too favourable prices, so any eventual corrections turn out to be very sudden and sharp

The result is a giant economy running a fledgling currency internationally, outsourcing its monetary policy and its international requirements for money (as a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value) to the globally dominant currency

The major economies, while recognising the domestic impact of the policies of others, have yet to appropriately factor mutual interdependence into their utility functions and policy deliberations

I would like to focus my remarks on his main critique – which he shared with Robert Triffin – that the international monetary system remains incapable of imposing an acceptable macroeconomic discipline on the world economy

Like the SDR, it offers a welcome alternative to the reliance on one dominant national currency for stability, and should have the effect of eroding the exorbitant privilege of the US dollar and increasing the policy discipline on all major, internationally-used currencies

That was a field Tommaso bore responsibility for at the ECB and which I inherited from him

The problem is that economic policy actions, particularly those of larger countries, create quantitatively significant spillovers, or “externalities”, for other countries

As Tommaso argued, there is also some lack of recognition of the fundamental flaws in the present monetary arrangements, or rather non-arrangements

For example, despite the financial crisis, policy incentives arising from the US’s exorbitant privilege remain unchanged in the presence of sizeable and liquid US financial markets and the strong international role of the dollar as a reserve currency

Selected Sentences:
It stood at 3% in November, according the Eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from previous months, still significantly lower than in the US

However, the need for structural reform does not stop with the euro area countries hit most by the sovereign debt crisis

At the same time, activity should benefit from continued positive economic growth in the emerging market economies, the continued extremely low levels of short-term interest rates and the various measures that have been implemented to support the functioning of the financial sector

Stability criteria were violated, fiscal rules ignored and statistics tweaked

To tackle the crisis decisively first and foremost requires tackling its root cause will require ambitious fiscal policies and structural reforms

Indeed, economic activity in the euro area is adversely affected by a moderation in the pace of global demand

Unfortunately, that cannot be said of all policymakers involved, resulting in the lingering of the sovereign debt crisis

These scenarios highlight the significant fiscal challenges we are facing on both sides of the Atlantic in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis

This is a major difference with quantitative easing in other major countries where such bond purchases are conducted in financing governments and against the background of official interest rates being close to the lower zero bound

In the same vein, competitiveness positions worsened in many euro area countries, due to a lack of structural reforms

Finally, income from fees and commissions has continued to produce a stable revenue flow for euro area LCBGs, and even increasing somewhat in the late 2009 and early 2010, boosted in particular by revenues from underwriting government and non-financial corporate sector debt securities issuances

After the sizeable net losses, which were endured by around half of the euro area large and complex banking groups (LCBGs) in late 2008, many of them returned to modest profitability during 2009

There is a large degree of cross-country heterogeneity within the euro area with some countries having endured annual increases in bankruptcies of more than 70% in 2009

Most of them have increased their Tier 1 capital, while many have also reduced their assets

This increase in estimated losses on commercial property loans is expected to more than offset the recovery in the valuations of commercial mortgage-backed securities held by banks in the euro area

[1]The cut-off date for data included in the June 2010 FSR was 19 May 2010

The third risk that has been identified within the euro area financial system is that of heightened financial market volatility if macroeconomic outcomes fail to live up to expectations

By early May this year, adverse market dynamics had taken hold across a range of asset markets in an environment of diminishing market liquidity

Two snap-shots are shown in the chart: one for 26 November 2009 and the other for 19 May 2010

Hence, notwithstanding a recovery in economic activity, it might still take some time before a normalisation of bankruptcies would be observed

At this point Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands wished to remove economic barriers among Member States, but wanted to remain within the Bretton Woods system of stable exchange rates

Structural reforms in the labour, goods and capital markets are a key element of any long-run strategy to improve investment, growth and employment prospects, and are essential in order to face successfully the challenges ahead of population ageing, technological change and globalisation

This implies that euro area investors have reallocated their portfolio holdings within the euro area, as a consequence of the establishment of EMU

This implies that financial systems are more exposed to common risks, as financial disturbances may be transmitted more easily across borders in periods of turbulence

Obstfeld, M

For the euro area, these international linkages are highly significant, particularly because economies of scale and cross-country technological spillovers support euro area economic growth

A second important factor is related to the effect of EMU on the business cycle of Member States, the consequent impact on asset returns and, as a result, on portfolio diversification by international investors

Sources: BIS, IMF, ECB calculations

Ireland in the late 1980s and Spain and some others in the mid-1990s) have benefited from strong supply-side effects on growth and – rather quickly – from the confidence effects of reform, which mitigated the adverse demand effects of fiscal consolidation

Speaker: Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa
Selected Sentences:
The third development I want to dwell upon is the organizational structure of financial groups

This has to be done primarily by developing a single rulebook and by achieving effective supervisory convergence

The newly created committee framework can cope with the challenges posed by this development, provided that its potential is exploited in full

An additional advantage of a single rulebook enshrined in secondary EU legislation is that it can be easily adapted to changing market conditions, under the “comitology” procedure

Finally, I will conclude with some measures that I see as crucial in addressing the challenges

I would very much like to hear the views of the industry representatives at this conference on the underlying reasons for choosing a particular, and often more costly, mode of establishment in other EU countries

Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very pleased to be here at this conference that deals with the important topic of supervisory convergence in Europe

The organizers decided to build this conference around four major themes and I have the pleasure to provide elements for discussion on the first question, namely how to deal with emerging pan-European financial institutions

On the other hand, when you establish subsidiaries you have to multiply all these elements by the number of countries you work in, which makes this structure extremely costly and cumbersome

They plead for the creation of a single European supervisor or at least for a “lead supervisor”, which would be the single point of contact for a financial group

Universities and researchers    My next topic relates to universities and researchers

It is therefore of the utmost importance to establish a procedure according to which the merits and costs for users, producers and reporting agents are weighed up when deciding whether or not to introduce new statistics

The ECB has established an internal merit and cost procedure for deciding whether or not to introduce new financial statistics

Of course, I do not deny the relevance of measuring particular national characteristics both for policy and for information purposes

Independence and fairness in providing data must not only rely on the professionalism of the experts but should also be based on an appropriate organisational framework

Not every new policy issue requires new statistics designed to respond to a specific question

The different functions and tasks of a central bank are clearly related, and the statistical information required for policy actions in these different areas has related or even common sources, requires similar methodological treatments and benefits from an integrated communication network

Selected Sentences:
In some rural areas where bank relationships are not very common banks face competition from loan co-operative and credit unions that are not subject to the same regulatory framework as banks

In the area of large-value payments, where systemic risk is important, the Eurosystem has an important oversight function with regard to all systems and an operational function in running its own payment system, the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system, or TARGET

Moreover, the EU and the acceding countries are highly interrelated from an institutional perspective

The role of the Eurosystem in the retail payments area thus clearly differs from that in the area of large-value payments

These measures also cover retail financial services

In principle, information and telecommunication technologies as well as the internet allow the entire payment process to be fully automated

All acceding countries have closed Chapter 3, "The freedom to provide services", and Chapter 4, "The free movement of capital", the chapters of the acquis communautaire that are most closely linked to banking

These challenges are connected with macroeconomic conditions, changes in regulatory frameworks and strengthening market forces

However, banks in the acceding countries continue to operate in a somewhat distinct environment

Nevertheless, the Governing Council of the ECB has decided that the acceding country central banks will have the same possibility – but not the obligation – as the current non-euro area central banks to connect to the existing TARGET system once they have joined the EU


Speaker: Christian Noyer
Selected Sentences:
Since then, the effects of these factors on the annual inflation rates have gradually disappeared

We therefore have to monitor monetary dynamics closely in the coming months

25% respectively, 150 basis points lower than a year earlier

However, monetary policy only affects the level of prices with a lag and cannot aim to control it in the short term

In addition to this, the quantification of the upward distortions to the official monetary growth figures provided evidence in early 2001 that the growth of M3 appeared to be less pronounced than originally thought

In fact, it was related to portfolio shifts from long-term to liquid short-term assets included in M3, which were initially linked to a relatively flat yield curve and a continued decline in stock prices and subsequently reinforced by the high financial market uncertainty caused by the terrorist attacks of 11 September

After these decisions, the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations stood at 3

It is my belief that the euro, as a visible symbol of European identity in everyday life, will increasingly bring these obstacles to light and stimulate efforts to eliminate them

Let me also report that at its meeting of 8 November 2001, the Governing Council decided that it would henceforth – as a rule – assess the stance of the ECB's monetary policy only at its first meeting of the month

When monetary policy is not flanked by the appropriate budgetary policy, and when labour markets - but also goods and services markets - are not flexible, bringing inflation under control will take time

Thanks go, too, to the European Commission, with which we have been able - after a little trial and error, and with both sides demonstrating good will and a certain ability to listen - to draw up the rules of the game for the indispensable co-operation which is needed to enable the project of Economic and Monetary Union to go ahead
