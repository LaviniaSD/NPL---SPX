      "[list(['Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the organisers Jan-Peter Krahnen and Hans-Helmut Kotz for inviting me to speak at the fifth edition of the Frankfurt Conference on Financial Market Policy', 'The theme of the conference is well-chosen', 'Despite significant improvements to its architecture over recent years, there is a clear sense that Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU, remains incomplete', 'There is much less clarity and precious little agreement on what a complete EMU would look like, however', 'This is why the question posed by the organisers – “how much federalism” – is so relevant', 'In my remarks, I would like to first review how federalism has evolved in the EU, highlighting that it is as much a process as it is an end-state', 'I will then – drawing on the economic concept of fiscal federalism – look more at the question of “how much federalism”, focusing on issue of risk-sharing and the role of different levels of governance within EMU', 'Federalism in the EU The nature of the discussion on federalism in Europe has changed quite dramatically over time', 'Shortly after the Second World War, the ambition for some was to create a “United States of Europe”, mainly as a way to avoid renewed, devastating war', 'This vision was shared by those who laid the foundations of the European Union in the 1950s, most notably Jean Monnet, the first President of the European Coal and Steel Community', 'From today’s perspective, it may seem surprising that the start of such a grand project was confined to an area as specific as coal and steel', 'But Monnet and the other early architects of European integration clearly understood that political federalism was the end-point of long process, which had to be achieved incrementally and through focused actions in limited policy areas where the benefits of European cooperation could be clearly seen', 'To quote one of Monnet’s contemporaries, Alcide de Gasperi,“we must begin by pooling only what is strictly essential to the achievement of our immediate aims, and do this by means of flexible formulae which can be gradually and progressively applied”', 'For these “fathers of Europe”, however, it was self-evident that such incremental measures would gradually move Europe deeper into federalism', 'Indeed, this clear sense of direction was, in their way, a key motor to keep the integration process moving forward', 'Since then, the European integration process has tended to move in waves', 'There have been times when it has stalled, such as the during the “empty chair crisis” in the 1960s', 'And there have been times when it has unexpectedly sped ahead, such as with the launch of the Single Market Act in the 1980s, and the commitment to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in the 1990s', 'But today, there is some confusion as to where we stand', 'In some ways, the degree of ambition to achieve a full political federation seems to have become more limited, which has led some to wonder whether the integration process will lose its forward momentum', 'This reflects in part the failure of the Constitution for Europe in 2005', 'The unsuccessful referendums in France and the Netherlands can be interpreted in different ways, but they clearly suggested that the people of the European Union were not ready to embark on the road towards full political federalism – or at least not at that point in time', 'It is also fair to say that the appetite for such federalism today is not much different from in 2005', 'In recent years there have been growing doubts about the European project', 'At the same time, polls consistently show that European citizens support federal decision-making in a wide range of areas, ranging from energy to migration to the fight against terrorism', 'This reflects the fact that the benefits of federalism are much broader than its economic, fiscal and monetary dimensions', 'Indeed, since the EU was originally devised as a peace-keeping device, it is not surprising that one of the early initiatives for European integration was a motion to establish a European Defence Community, although this failed in 1954', 'While a full defence union is probably still unrealistic, there are increasing signs that further integration in this area could happen in the near future', 'The Commission reflection paper published on 7 June of this year lays out proposals for establishing a European Defence Fund, which could form the nucleus of a future defence union', 'Last week, the European Council welcomed the significant progress made by Member States in preparing a Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in the field of defence, and the work done on the Commission’s proposal for a European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP)', 'All this clearly chimes with the preferences of European citizens, three-quarters of whom support “a common defence and security policy among EU Member States”', '[1]  The conclusion that follows is that we have to distinguish federalism as a state from federalism as a process', 'It may be the case that a full political federation is not currently desired by European citizens', 'But that does not mean that they reject the process of federalism – which is to say, the dynamic allocation and reallocation of responsibilities to different levels of government according to the preferences and needs of the time', 'While this process may benefit from the gravitational pull of a pre-defined end point, it can also advance without it, so long as actions are taken in areas where the benefits of cooperation are clear and the steps taken are legitimate in the eyes of citizens', 'Indeed, what gave the EU both momentum and popular legitimacy in the years after the war was its achievements – effective actions in specific areas – not necessarily the visions of a unified Europe', 'So how much federalism would satisfy these requirements today', 'One way to assess this is through looking at the economic aspects of federalism', 'Certainly, as Richard and Peggy Musgrave wrote, “economic analysis does not tell us what degree of closeness the member units of a federation should feel toward each other”', 'Political aspects transcend economic ones', 'But economic analysis can help us better understand the consequences of various institutional arrangements and choose the instruments we should use to pursue our common objectives', 'In the rest of my remarks I will zoom in on some of these aspects of federalism', 'Economic aspects of federalism An important theme – one aspect of which will be addressed in the first session today – is risk-sharing', 'The crisis has reminded us that both private and public risk-sharing are underdeveloped in Europe, and that this underdevelopment comes at huge cost', 'So, there is general agreement that risk-sharing channels need to be improved', 'There is less agreement on where the emphasis should lie', 'Some argue that the priority should be to strengthen private risk-sharing, by completing the banking union and establishing a truly integrated capital markets union', 'Others argue that EMU needs to focus on public risk-sharing, be it through introducing a central euro area fiscal capacity or creating safe assets', 'In reality, separating these two channels of risk-sharing is far from the obvious solution', 'Is private risk-sharing a substitute for public risk-sharing', 'Or do they complement each other', 'There are several arguments in support of the view that the two channels complement each other – but only if the right powers are matched at the federal level', 'For example, it is clear that the banking union would not fully achieve its goal of severing the toxic link between banks and national governments without a central fiscal backstop for the already-existing Single Resolution Fund, as well as for the European Deposit Insurance Scheme that is still under discussion', 'At the same time, fiscal backstops generally raise legitimate questions about incentive structures to protect taxpayers, which need to be addressed in parallel by appropriate fiscal governance at the federal level', 'The process of building the banking union also illustrates how important it is to reach an appropriate degree of federalism to achieve the objective of a stable and integrated financial system that supports the European economy', 'Ideally, in a genuine banking union banks would operate in the Single Market just as they operate in their domestic market', 'This is essential to reap the full benefits of financial integration', 'The country in which a bank is headquartered should be irrelevant', 'But, in practice, it remains relevant for as long as the consequences of potential bank failures are still predominantly national', 'The irrelevance of a bank’s headquarters, therefore, depends on the institutional structure of the banking union', 'Let me take one very specific example to illustrate my point', 'The banking union is not yet considered a single geographical area in the supervisory methodology applied to globally systematically important banks', 'These G-SIBs are subject to additional capital requirements, which are calibrated on the basis of a cross-jurisdictional indicator', 'This indicator reflects the fact that failures of global banks are more difficult to handle owing to coordination difficulties and cross-border spillover effects', 'When the responsibility for banks is shared, additional capital buffers for cross-border activities lose their raison d’être', 'A single set of harmonised prudential rules for all banks in the European Union would not, in and of itself, be sufficient for the EU to be considered as a single geographical area', 'But the Single Rulebook, the existence of a single supervisor, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), of a single resolution authority, the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), and of a common backstop, the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), when taken together, have equipped the banking union with all the features of a single geographical area', 'This should mean that the banking union is treated as a single geographical area in the supervisory methodology in future', 'Finally, there is the question of how to design fiscal risk-sharing mechanisms for EMU, while taking into account EMU’s unique nature', 'In existing federations the stabilisation function of the central budget is usually a by-product of redistribution via large tax transfer systems', 'At this stage of European integration, it is clear that any politically acceptable euro area fiscal capacity will be modest in size', 'So, the key question for the economics profession is whether it is possible to remove the link between the stabilisation function and the redistributive function, allowing for a central budget of moderate size to have a meaningful macroeconomic stabilisation effect', 'If this were possible, such a central budget could help monetary policy, especially in times of deep recessions when nominal interest rates may reach their effective lower bound', 'The European Commission set out some proposals in its reflection paper published on 31 May – these require further study', 'Conclusion Let me conclude', 'The answer to the question of today’s conference – “How much federalism', '” – is not easy', 'Yet, speaking as an economist, I think it is likely that the right answer lies on the side of “more than today” rather than “less than today”', 'Monnet famously said that “Europe will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises', '” He was certainly right that further integration will proceed incrementally rather than in a big bang', 'What I hope, though, is that Europe will not be forged in crises only', 'Significant progress towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union has been achieved in times of acute crisis', 'Today’s improved economic environment offers a window of opportunity to demonstrate that progress is possible in quieter times, too', 'I thank you for your attention and hope you have productive discussions at today’s conference', '[1] Standard Eurobarometer 87, Spring 2017 (fieldwork: May 2017)'])\n",
      " list(['I am very pleased to be here tonight on my \"home ground\" and to participate in this conference celebrating the 50th anniversary of Dutch banking supervisory legislation', 'I would like to thank President Wellink for giving me the opportunity to meet with this distinguished group of experts and former colleagues who have come together to discuss highly topical issues in the field of banking supervision', 'The law enacted 50 years ago formalised the role of De Nederlandsche Bank in banking supervision', 'These duties had to some extent developed \"organically\", through the history of the Bank, out of its original function as provider of liquidity to commercial banks and its gathering of statistical data from them', 'I should probably not boast too much as I was myself involved in overseeing the Dutch banking system in my former position as the President of De Nederlandsche Bank', 'However, the supervisory system in the Netherlands has been undeniably successful', 'Dutch banks – like the financial system as a whole – have prospered and steadily improved their efficiency, and the stability of the system as a whole has generally withstood structural changes and episodes of financial market turbulence', 'The fact that we are celebrating a supervisory law which was established so long ago might give an image of a static regulatory and supervisory system', 'Some sceptical observers even take the general view that supervisory structures are rigid and are only ever discussed critically after major disruptions in the financial system', 'As we know, this image does not correspond to reality', 'In the Netherlands, many adjustments have been introduced over time in response to market developments rather than crisis events', 'For instance, co-operation mechanisms between the authorities in charge of supervising banks, securities firms and insurance companies were established – in the form of the \"Raad van Financiële Toezichthouders (RFT)\" – in reaction to the growing importance of financial conglomerates and the development of close links between different financial products', 'Moreover, the Dutch Ministry of Finance proposed last year – with subsequent approval by Parliament – to strengthen the role of the central bank in the prudential supervision of banks and financial conglomerates and to establish even closer links with the prudential supervision of insurance companies', 'These responsibilities are separate from the tasks of overseeing the conduct-of-business and consumer protection aspects', 'Among other things, this model honours the close links between the systemic stability interests of central banks and the prudential supervision of financial institutions', 'Financial stability is always in the direct interest of central banks, because of its importance for the successful conduct of the basic central banking tasks in the fields of monetary policy and payment systems', 'Although one should always be cautious in exporting national institutional structures to other countries, the Dutch model might provide useful insights to others', 'The current supervisory landscape in other European Union countries, as well as at the Community level, is also far from being static', 'Discussions of the appropriate institutional structures and mechanisms have intensified both at the national and European level', 'These debates are very healthy and demonstrate an active response by policy-makers to the development of cross-sectoral links in the financial industry, as well as to the changes brought about by the euro and financial integration', 'Tonight, I would like to review briefly these national and European discussions', 'As the issues are manifold, I would like to concentrate on the role of the national central banks and the Eurosystem in prudential supervision', 'The role of the Eurosystem is rooted in the Maastricht Treaty, which gives it the task of contributing to prudential supervision and financial stability, while keeping the primary responsibilities in these areas at the national level', 'Let me first turn to national developments', 'Following the creation of the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom, proposals have been put forward in a number of European countries, for instance in Austria, Germany and Ireland, to set up a single supervisory authority in charge of all financial institutions', 'In some cases – unlike here in the Netherlands – the proposals have also included a reduced role for the central bank in prudential supervision, while increasing the responsibilities of the separate supervisory agency', 'In ten out of twelve euro area countries, the central bank is still either directly responsible or otherwise closely involved in the operational conduct of supervisory duties', 'Only in Luxembourg and Belgium this is not the case, and in the latter a reform is being proposed that increases significantly the involvement of the central bank', 'As we have often said, the Eurosystem strongly supports a continued involvement of national central banks in prudential supervision, although the institutional set-up of financial supervision needs to be tailored to the structure of the respective national financial system', 'Any solution other than direct responsibility should be coupled with close co-operation and operational involvement of central banks in order to allow the potential synergies between central banking and prudential supervision to be exploited', \"Central banks' knowledge of the overall economy and financial system, and their information from payment and settlement systems and monetary policy operations, are valuable for the performance of the supervisory tasks\", 'Conversely, for central banks, supervisory information can play an important role in the oversight of payment and settlement systems and of market infrastructures, and in managing liquidity crises', 'Strong comments have been made against this view', 'The most often used arguments against central bank involvement in supervision have been the increasing importance of financial conglomerates and the blurring of the distinction between the three segments of the financial sector', 'These developments would call for the establishment of a single financial supervisor which should not be the central bank – the argument runs – since this would worsen conflicts-of-interest between central banking and prudential supervision and would lead to a concentration of power', 'In my view, one should not be too dogmatic about these arguments', 'Situations in which such conflicts of interest would arise are very rare in practice and central banks, like all other public bodies, are subject to accountability procedures', 'In any case, these concerns are dispelled in the euro area setting by the fact that decision-making takes place at different levels: euro area-wide for monetary policy, national for prudential supervision', 'The arguments for keeping central banks closely involved in prudential supervision are even reinforced in the context of Monetary Union', 'More integrated financial markets can absorb shocks more easily than in the past, which is a very beneficial outcome', 'However, if shocks do occur, they are likely to have a wider impact across borders through wholesale banking and capital market links – or through payment and settlement systems', 'Thus, the contribution of the Eurosystem to monitoring vulnerabilities in the financial system on a euro area-wide basis will be greater if the central banks are extensively involved in prudential supervision', 'Let me move on to the European debate', 'The Economic and Financial Committee has already assessed the adequacy of the existing arrangements for prudential supervision and the safeguarding of financial stability in the European Union in the two reports produced under the chairmanship of Henk Brouwer from De Nederlandsche Bank', 'I wish to congratulate him on these important achievements', 'The outcome of this analysis was that the current institutional system based on national responsibility is appropriate, but there is a need to strengthen cross-border and cross-sectoral co-operation between supervisors, to enhance convergence in supervisory practices and to reinforce collaboration between supervisory and central banking functions', 'The Eurosystem supports these conclusions', 'There are clear benefits in keeping supervision close to the institutions being overseen at the national level, while financial integration requires co-operation between the relevant authorities to be stepped up', 'In my view, positive developments have already occurred in the implementation of these recommendations', 'For example, the Banking Supervision Committee of the European System of Central Banks – chaired by Deutsche Bundesbank Directorate member Edgar Meister – has enhanced and continues to develop its regular monitoring of the soundness of the European Union banking system as a whole, as well as its analysis of structural banking and financial developments', 'These activities rely extensively on the close and constructive co-operation established within the Committee between central banks and banking supervisory authorities', 'Indeed, the Eurosystem regards the promotion of co-operation between central banks and supervisory authorities as one of its main contributions in the field of prudential supervision', 'However, the full implementation of the \"Brouwer recommendations\" requires additional work in order to establish an effective information exchange – both in times of calm and in times of crisis – and to achieve further convergence in supervisory practices', 'In addition to the financial stability considerations, the issue of supervisory co-operation also needs to be looked at from the angle of the efficiency of the financial system', 'Indeed, increasing attention is being paid by policy-makers and market participants to the remaining inefficiencies in the financial sector and the residual obstacles to financial integration', 'For instance, the recent \"Gyllenhammar report\" drew attention to the need for greater standardisation of supervisory compliance requirements and practices because of the cost burden on financial institutions developing cross-border businesses', 'These conclusions were further reinforced in the recent report by the Economic and Financial Committee under the chairmanship of yet another compatriot of mine – Kees van Dijkhuizen, the Dutch Treasurer-General', 'In a similar quest for greater efficiency, considerable attention has also been paid to the Community regulatory process, with emphasis on the need to achieve swift rule-making and consistent implementation in different Member States', 'The recent institutional agreement achieved on the implementation of the \"Lamfalussy procedures\" represents a major step forward in the field of securities regulation', 'It removes the burden of detailed and cumbersome regulation at the Community level by delegating rule-making powers to a committee of regulators and by promoting consistent implementation at the national level through a committee of supervisors', 'Extending such a mechanism to banking and insurance would probably also produce tangible benefits, though differences existing between the three sectors should be taken into account', 'As we know, a particularly important regulatory exercise is ahead in the transposition of the new Basel Capital Accord into the EU regulatory framework, in which the European Commission will play a key role', 'All in all, there are strong reasons to continue deepening supervisory co-operation at the EU level', 'The current debate on how to achieve this objective is intense, and not yet finished', 'I perceive the part played by the Eurosystem in nurturing this debate not – as it has been suggested – as an attempt to enhance the supervisory role of the ECB but instead as a constructive contribution to setting up a comprehensive architecture for an effective multilateral supervisory co-operation', 'The latter, I believe, is a common goal of central banks, supervisory authorities and ministries of finance', 'In the banking sector, the Eurosystem feels – in line with what I highlighted earlier – that there is a need for continued involvement of central banks in multilateral supervisory co-operation, along the lines of the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision', 'I would definitely not welcome a solution that would alter the current situation by excluding central banks without supervisory responsibilities from supervisory co-operation', 'Firewalls should not be unnecessarily created between central banks and supervisory bodies', 'The Banking Supervision Committee of the ESCB is an existing EU forum catering for co-operation between central banks and supervisory authorities', 'In principle, it could also be suitable as a forum for co-operation between banking supervisors, provided that it operated in a setting which ensured an adequate degree of autonomy for this activity', 'To conclude, I would like to congratulate De Nederlandsche Bank, as well as the Dutch Ministry of Finance, on their constructive contribution to the recent European and global developments in supervision and regulation', 'I also wish you the best of success for the continuation of the conference tomorrow'])\n",

challenges, often the very urgent trumps the similarly vitally important', 'It is tempting and frankly quite human to focus the attention on the most immediately pressing challenges', 'Climate-related and environmental (C&E) financial risks might thus not seem the most obvious topic for a keynote speech at this moment', 'However, exactly one week ago the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its Synthesis Report, according to which temperatures have already risen to 1', '1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels', 'This worrisome observation reminds us that addressing the increasing risks from the ongoing climate and environment crises is both highly urgent and vitally important', 'This is the reason why in this keynote I want to stress that “we have no time to lose regarding the sustainable transformation”; that we need to “step up the global ambition to meet the Paris Agreement goals”; that our world needs “more ambition to accelerate the change towards a net-zero economy”; and that “financial institutions can and must play a key role in driving the world towards net-zero carbon emissions”', 'I want to talk about the importance of “aligning credit portfolios with the objectives of the Paris Agreement” and “managing climate-related risks as a priority action”', 'These words don’t beat around the bush', 'These words express clear ambitions', 'These words cut to the heart of the matter', 'However, these words did not come from the ECB, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) or the IPCC', 'These are your words', 'And by this, I mean literal quotes from the CEOs of banks that have signed the Net-Zero Banking Alliance – a group committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement', 'Most of these banks are also members of the FBA', 'These words show that you want to play a pivotal role in the transition to net zero', 'These words articulate your ambition to make climate-related and environmental considerations a key pillar of your strategy', 'In this keynote speech, I would like to give you an update on where banks under ECB supervision currently stand relative to their stated ambitions, and what still needs to be done to adequately address C&E risks from a prudential point of view', 'But first, a few words about regulators and supervisors', 'Just as it is the case for banks, a broad global consensus has also emerged in our community on the need to make C&E considerations an integral part of our DNA', 'Evolving international supervisory consensus regarding C&E risks Let me first very briefly revisit the simple guiding principle driving prudential regulators around the globe: ensuring that no material risks\\xa0are left\\xa0unaddressed', 'It is enshrined in the BCBS core principles and has been a legal requirement for decades', 'According to this principle, banks must identify and adequately manage the risks they are exposed to', 'Just as for any other material source of risk, this also holds true for C&E risks', 'To be clear, it is not for us as supervisors to tell banks how green their lending policies must be', 'However, we insist that not taking into account the transition towards a more sustainable economy is no longer compatible with sound risk management', 'To this end, the ECB has strongly supported a rapidly growing global coalition in acknowledging that C&E risks form an integral part of our mandate', 'A key motivation to address this risk at the global level was to create a level playing field for banks to tackle what everyone agrees is a material source of financial risk', 'To ensure that European banks are indeed in a position to manage C&E risks, as early as in 2020 the ECB published a guide on C&E risks[1] for banks', 'The guide demonstrated the ECB’s commitment to making the financial system more resilient to these risks', 'It set out 13 supervisory expectations for how the banks under our supervision should integrate C&E risks into their business models and strategies, governance and risk appetite to increase the resilience of their portfolios', 'In doing so, we were moving very much in lockstep with the global principles for supervising C&E risks, building on the prevailing best practices identified by the global Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)', 'During the two years following the publication of the ECB supervisory expectations, we conducted several supervisory exercises on banks’ approaches to managing these risks', 'We started with banks’ self-assessments in 2021, followed by a climate stress test and thematic review of C&E risks in 2022', 'Last year’s supervisory exercises were stepping stones to what I would call an immersive supervisory approach[2] which is aimed at holistically integrating C&E risks into all parts of the supervisory dialogue with banks', 'Many examples from around the globe show that prudential regulators and supervisors have embarked on this immersive supervisory approach', 'For instance, as early as 2019 the Bank of England published its climate-related supervisory expectations addressed to banks and insurers', '[3] In 2020 the Philippines gave banks three years to develop transition plans with specific timelines to implement board-approved sustainability principles into their governance and risk management', 'In the United States earlier this year the Federal Reserve launched a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise assessing banks’ resilience to a set of forward-looking scenarios', 'Earlier this month, the Canadian financial regulator OSFI released final guidelines outlining how financial firms should manage climate-related risks', 'Also, the NGFS now brings together 121 members from around the globe', 'This shows that more and more authorities are committed to ensuring the sound management of climate-related risks by the banks they supervise', 'Based on this global convergence of supervisory expectations, I am always puzzled whenever I hear that Europe is allegedly too ambitious in tackling C&E risks', 'The pace at which we are moving is very much in lockstep with our global peers', 'Thanks to the BCBS’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risks, which I co-chair with Kevin Stiroh from the US Federal Reserve, we took steps in converging the plethora of international expectations into an initial formal consensus', 'As a result, there is progress on all three pillars of the Basel Framework for the prudential regulation of banks', 'For instance, in June 2022 the BCBS published the Pillar 2 principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks[4], and it expects implementation as soon as possible', 'To ensure this, the BCBS made the monitoring of progress across jurisdictions a key element of its 2023-24 work programme', 'This is good news since this global approach ensures a level playing field for a source of risk that everyone agrees is material to them', 'Moreover, as a first step on Pillar 1, the BCBS has recently published a set of frequently asked questions to clarify how climate-related financial risks may be captured in the existing Pillar 1 framework', 'The BCBS’s guidance tells banks how they can already consider material climate-related risks in their regulatory capital', 'For instance, when determining the property value of real estate, banks may consider climate-related impacts', 'In Europe, discussions on possible changes to the Pillar 1 framework will take place on the basis of the technical analysis being performed by the European Banking Authority', 'I welcome this approach as it ensures that the prudential framework remains risk based', 'In the field of disclosures, I am similarly pleased to see a consolidation of various international initiatives at the Basel level', 'Building on the extensive work that has already been done in various fora, the BCBS has started developing high-quality and globally consistent “Pillar 3” climate-related disclosure requirements', 'The BCBS will issue a consultation paper on the proposed framework by the end of this year', 'This is a welcome step given that banks’ own shareholders are becoming increasingly demanding in this field, especially in banks that have publicly committed to achieving net-zero targets', 'In the context of the international regulatory advancements I have just outlined, I would like to reassure you that the ECB’s commitment to follow a risk-based approach to C&E risks will remain strong in the future too', 'Together with you, the internationally active banks, we can ensure that the same level of ambition in tackling C&E risks is kept around the world', 'I expect the international banking community to raise a loud voice in the various international fora', 'A voice that advocates and supports an ambitious level playing field on C&E risk management', 'A voice I have already heard you use on many occasions, in many public statements', 'For instance, one bank explicitly mentions in its annual report that being profitable in the long term goes hand in hand with environmental performance', 'Another bank talks of its strong commitment to being a key partner to clients on their path to a more climate-friendly economy', 'Your own statements clearly demonstrate that banks do not lack ambition', 'But what banks need to ensure now is that this ambition is also translated into practice', 'This is the only way to remain sound in a net-zero carbon future', 'The current state of banks’ C&E risk management After having revisited the broad regulatory consensus, let me now reflect on where the banks under ECB supervision currently stand in integrating C&E risks into their strategy and risk management', 'I will illustrate this using takeaways from the two supervisory exercises conducted by the ECB in 2022: a climate stress test and thematic review of C&E risks', 'Jointly, these exercises gave us a full picture of how banks are performing relative to our supervisory expectations', 'On aggregate the results are mixed', 'We see the glass filling up slowly, but it is not yet even half full', 'This is both good and bad news: good news because there is progress compared with where banks were some years ago; bad news because banks are still a long way from where they need to be', 'On the positive side, banks have made meaningful progress in accounting for and addressing C&E risks', 'For instance, most banks acknowledge the materiality of these risks in their portfolios', 'This means that there is broad consensus among banks that C&E risks are a material source of financial risk and that they are impossible to evade', 'As a result, banks have made progress in integrating C&E risks into their risk management processes, which is not an easy task', 'It is thanks to thousands of C&E risk experts working very hard in banks all over Europe, from Lisbon to Helsinki, from Dublin to Athens, that this progress has been made', 'However, despite the improvements, we have concluded that overall risk management capabilities are still insufficient', 'In other words, there is still a material gap between where banks currently stand and our supervisory expectations', 'Let me illustrate this with three examples', 'First, in the climate stress test we found that three in five banks still do not have a climate stress testing framework in place', 'Among the banks that do, we found that most do not ensure independence between the development and validation functions of the stress testing framework', 'Second, the thematic review showed that virtually all banks have blind spots in the identification of C&E risks', 'One such blind spot is the lack of consideration of the physical risks posed by the climate and environmental crises', 'For example, even though water stress is on the rise and already affects 30% of Europeans in an average year, less than one-third of banks consider this risk driver in their strategic risk impact assessments', 'Third, there are broader environmental risks that go beyond purely climate-related risks that banks still focus too little on', 'We are currently observing an unprecedented decline of natural ecosystems and their vital services, with 75% of land surface and 66% of ocean ecosystems damaged, degraded or modified', '[5] This is also concerning economically given that more than half of global GDP depends on nature', '[6] Therefore, nature degradation for example through biodiversity loss is also emerging as a material source of financial risk', 'Our supervisory expectations explicitly apply to the management of both climate-related and environmental risks, both of which are a material source of financial risk', 'However, many banks have so far come up with only a high-level description of the general impact on vulnerable sectors, like agriculture, mining and manufacturing, and have yet to perform adequate materiality assessments', 'As the two supervisory exercises demonstrated, for the glass to become full – that is complying with our supervisory expectations – banks must considerably increase the pace of progress', 'And I will now outline how this can be done', 'The way ahead for banks and supervisors In line with the guiding principle that no material risk should remain unaddressed, we expect all banks under our supervision to be fully aligned with our expectations by the end of 2024 at the latest', 'This clear implementation deadline also ensures a level playing field for all banks in the banking union', 'In other words, after 2024, a limbo of identifying a risk as material but not adequately addressing it will no longer be tolerated', 'However, we are mindful of the challenges banks may face in aligning with our supervisory expectations', 'To smooth the transition further, we have also set some intermediate deadlines for banks to reach specific milestones', 'For example, by the end of March 2023 we expect all banks to have a sound and comprehensive materiality assessment and business environment scan in place', 'This means that banks must make an explicit judgement on the impact of C&E risks through various transmission channels in the short, medium and long term across their portfolios', 'Insufficiently documenting the non-materiality of certain portfolios will no longer be acceptable', 'Let me insist that by now all key ingredients to make C&E risks an integral part of banks’ strategy and risk management are well known', 'But you – the banks – are in the lead when it comes to translating ambitions into practice by designing and implementing tools to adequately manage these risks', 'One of the silver linings of our supervisory exercises last year is that we have published the good practices observed in both the climate stress test[7] and the thematic review[8]', 'To give a telling example, in the area of governance some front runners have already integrated C&E risks into the work of the management body', 'For example, in one bank the management body approves the environmental strategy and risk management framework and oversees their implementation in day-to-day processes', 'It is supported in this work by a dedicated committee, most of whose members are independent directors and bring the appropriate level of knowledge and experience of C&E risks', 'Another good practice can be seen in the use of transition planning tools aimed at managing the risks of the transition', 'This involves using scientific pathways to assess the alignment of banks’ portfolios with the Paris Agreement and designing clear and actionable plans to address observed misalignments', 'With these good practices, banks now have access to very practical suggestions on how to accelerate progress', 'Knowing that no “one-size-fits-all” approach exists, let me assure you that, as part of the ongoing supervisory dialogue, our supervisory teams are there to discuss specific implementation challenges with each bank Finally, I would like to stress that we will closely monitor banks’ progress with respect to the deadlines, and, if necessary, we will use all measures in our toolkit to ensure compliance with our expectations', 'These include imposing periodic penalty payments and setting Pillar 2 capital requirements as part of the annual Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process', 'Conclusion Let me conclude', 'Over the last couple of years, a global consensus has emerged among regulators, supervisors and banks around the need to tackle the financial risks stemming from ongoing climate and environmental crises', 'As underlined by the latest worrisome observations from last week’s IPCC report, it is both highly urgent and vitally important for banks to be able to identify and manage C&E risks', '2023 is a crucial year for translating ambitions into sound internal practices, for which substantial progress is needed', 'I hope I can count on your full commitment so that by the end of 2024 we can conclude that banks are “managing climate-related risks as a priority”, as articulated by one of your peers that signed the Net-Zero Banking Alliance', 'This would, of course, not be the end of the journey, as C&E risks, like any other mainstream risk, demand continuous attention and adaptation', 'But it would be a crucial step to making the banking system resilient to the twin climate and environmental crises,

World’European Banking Center at Venice International UniversityVenice, 25-26 September 2009      Introduction [1]     The recent financial crisis has produced a broad consensus on analysis and policy action in at least three areas, namely the need: i) to gain a better understanding of systemic risk; ii) to strengthen the macro-prudential aspects of financial supervision; and iii) to deepen central banks’ involvement in it', 'The establishment of a new body to conduct macro-prudential supervision at EU level – the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) – is one element in a comprehensive set of initiatives and responses in this field', 'My remarks today focus on the future work of this body and consist of four parts', 'I’ll first consider the origins, purpose and structure of the ESRB', 'In second place, I’ll discuss the concept of systemic risk, and how it can be monitored and assessed effectively', 'I’ll examine some analytical tools for systemic risk analysis in the EU and look at how these tasks could be organised in the context of the ESRB', 'In the third part, I’ll cover the ECB’s experience in conducting financial stability surveillance in the euro area and reflect on the vulnerabilities that we (and other authorities) identified before the crisis', 'I’ll ask why the communications about the risks that built up were insufficient to prevent the crisis', 'The fourth part is a what if', 'What if the Risk Board had existed in the early 2000s – could the factors that led to the crisis have been identified and averted', 'The answer should point to some of the key advantages of (and reasons for) the EU’s new macro-prudential function', '1', 'The setting-up of the European Systemic Risk Board     The idea of establishing a body to monitor and assess systemic risk at European level was first mooted in the late 1990s', '[2] It took over a decade and a financial crisis to implement it', 'Let me recall the milestones of the setting-up of the ESRB institutional framework', 'Following the recommendations of the de Larosière Report, in February this year, the main features of the institutional framework for macro-prudential supervision were defined by the Communication published by the European Commission on 27 May as well as the Conclusions approved by the ECOFIN Council on 9 June and by the European Council on 18 and 19 June', 'The European Systemic Risk Board will be responsible for the macro-prudential oversight of the financial system within the European Union', 'It will seek to prevent or mitigate systemic risks within the financial system, so as to avoid widespread financial distress, and it will contribute to a smooth functioning of the Internal Market and ensure a sustainable contribution of the financial sector to economic growth', 'Its tasks will be to identify and assess risks to systemic stability in the EU, issue risk warnings where risks appear to be significant and, where necessary, give recommendations on measures to be taken to contain such risks and follow up on their implementation', 'The Risk Board will have 33 full members: the 27 EU central bank Governors, the ECB President and Vice-President, a Commission member and the three Chairs of the new European Supervisory Authorities', 'To ensure close cooperation with supervisors, a representative from one national supervisory authority for each EU country may attend the meetings of the ESRB, but will have no voting rights', 'In addition, the President of the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) will participate, but likewise will have no voting rights', 'The ECB was requested by ECOFIN to provide the necessary analytical, statistical, administrative and logistical support, and to draw on technical advice from the national central banks and supervisors', 'This is a clear recognition of the important role that central banks have gained over time in monitoring financial stability', 'The Commission proposals specify in detail the new institutional arrangements concerning the establishment of the ESRB and the involvement of the ECB', 'The ECB/Eurosystem will provide its views when formally consulted according to the Treaty provisions', 'Indeed, further work is needed to clarify and optimise the details of the institutional framework for the ESRB as well as for the new European Supervisory Authorities for micro-prudential supervision', 'Sound institutional arrangements are a crucial pre-condition for the effectiveness of these supervisory reforms in general and the establishment of the Risk Board in particular', 'In this context, let me mention two key elements to be defined by the forthcoming legislation', 'One is the arrangements for the exchange of micro-prudential information among national supervisors, the new European Supervisory Authorities and the ESRB (subject to specific confidentiality agreements)', 'In order for the ESRB to perform its functions, it should have the power to request any information it deems necessary (for example, exposures of large and complex financial institutions to structured products)', '[3]  The other key element is that a risk warning needs to be translated into appropriate supervisory action', 'An institutional mechanism should exist to ensure that the recommendations adopted by the ESRB as regards the actions to address the systemic risks identified by the macro-prudential assessment would be followed up by the competent national authorities', 'However, as the recommendations will not be binding, there should be institutional mechanisms to ensure that they are implemented', 'And if they are not implemented, an explanation has to be provided', 'The ESRB may decide to make the recommendations public', 'As the recommendations aim to address systemic risks, their publication will increase pressure on the Member State to implement such recommendations', 'A peer review mechanism should be set up', 'In particular, the ECB, on behalf of the Risk Board, would closely monitor the implementation of the recommendations by Member States and national authorities', 'Cases of non-compliance could be reported to the Council and, where relevant, to the European Supervisory Authorities for appropriate follow-up', '2', 'The concept of systemic risk and its analysis by the ESRB    How well this institutional framework will enable the ESRB to perform its tasks will depend on its understanding of systemic risk, the amount of relevant information at its disposal, the analytical tools that are available to assess the risks, and the framework used to distil the most important results from all these elements', 'Let me comment on some of these four aspects and touch on how we intend to fulfil our mandate to support the ESRB', 'Conceptual issues of systemic risk    Systemic risk analysis is nothing new to the central banking community, including the ECB', 'One reflection of this fact is the series of triennial central bank conferences held under the G10 Committee on the Global Financial System between the mid-1990s and early 2000s', 'Even the European Monetary Institute, which was the forerunner of the ECB, contributed to systemic risk work in this context, alongside the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and many other central banks', '[4] For instance, from the outset, the ECB drew up a research agenda on financial stability and systemic risk', '[5] In addition, in 2004 we started to publish a Financial Stability Report (FSR) twice a year', 'The main objective of this Report is to help identify, at an early stage, potential vulnerabilities and to raise awareness among market participants with a view to promoting preventive and remedial policies', 'Each issue also contains several special features offering a wealth of further insight into financial stability and systemic risk', 'This background suggests that the ECB is a logical choice as a provider of analytical support to the ESRB, but it should not obscure two major challenges we are facing', 'First, the phenomenon of systemic risk is extraordinarily complex', 'Second, despite the steps reported above and some lively academic literature on financial contagion over the last two decades, systemic risk analysis and research is far less advanced than that of monetary policy, for example', 'There are no established frameworks that can be taken ‘straight off the shelf’', 'Having said that, let me describe briefly the concept of systemic risk', 'Systemic risk was defined by the G10 in 2001 as “… the risk that an event will trigger a loss of economic value or confidence in, and attendant increases in uncertainty about, a substantial portion of the financial system that is serious enough to quite probably have significant adverse effects on the real economy', '” [6] In simpler terms, it is the risk that the failure and distress of a significant part of the financial sector reduces the availability of credit, which in turn may adversely affect the real economy', 'Interestingly, this notion of systemic risk is quite similar to the definition of financial stability that the ECB uses in its Financial Stability Report, underlining the fact that our financial stability work has always had a macro-prudential orientation', 'Our working definition describes financial stability as a “ condition in which the financial system – comprising of financial intermediaries, markets and market infrastructures – is capable of withstanding shocks and the unravelling of imbalances, thereby mitigating the likelihood of disruptions in the financial intermediation process which are severe enough to significantly impair the allocation of savings to profitable investment opportunities”', 'Following de Bandt, Hartmann and Peydró-Alcalde (forthcoming), we can distinguish three broad and interrelated ways in which systemic risk can materialise', '[7] The first one is commonly called contagion and is closely studied in the research literature', 'For example, a supposedly idiosyncratic failure of a financial intermediary leads to the failure of other intermediaries', 'The second one emerges from imbalances that build up over time, such as credit booms or concentrations of lending in certain regions or sectors', 'These ‘bubbles’ can go on profitably for most participants who ‘ride’ them for quite a while', 'Then relatively small events or changes in expectations can lead to their breakdown, simultaneously bringing down a wide range of intermediaries and markets', '[8] The third way in which systemic risk can materialise relates to economic downturns or other aggregate shocks that cause the collapse of a wide range of intermediaries and markets simultaneously', '[9]  Other important elements in systemic risk include the strong information intensity of financial contracts and transactions, and a high degree of connectedness between financial intermediaries and markets as well as a strong reliance on debt financing (leverage) and on maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities', 'These factors imply feedback mechanisms that amplify shocks and can lead to non-linearities in the financial system that then are easily transmitted to the real economy', 'Systemic stability, or the absence of systemic risk, can be seen as a public good, thereby legitimising the role of governments and other authorities in addressing it', '[10] Like pollution, systemic risk involves externalities, in the sense that each financial intermediary manages its own risks but does not consider its impact on the risk of the system as a whole', 'The financial crisis contributed considerably to a better understanding of the phenomenon of systemic risk, which is also reflected in aspects of regulatory reforms', 'In particular, the possibility of aligning capital requirements to a measure of firms’ systemic risk contribution is being contemplated by regulators, e', 'g', 'the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision', '[11]  How could the ESRB then structure its supervisory work on systemic risk', 'In broad terms, systemic risk analysis can be broken down into two core components: i) surveillance, or risk detection, and ii) risk assessment, each of which I will address in turn', 'Risk detection    Financial stability surveillance concerns risk identification', 'This kind of surveillance mainly aims to detect potential sources of risk, especially financial vulnerabilities – that is weaknesses which, if unearthed, could lead to a disruption or failure in part of the financial system and potentially to a financial crisis', 'It would have to pay attention to the sources of the three forms of systemic risk discussed earlier – contagion, imbalances and macro shocks', 'Risk monitoring should identify sources of risks and vulnerability coming from within the financial system – i', 'e', 'stemming from financial institutions, markets or market infrastructure – and also those present in the macroeconomic environment and non-financial related events', 'These would include vulnerabilities resulting from global imbalances, growth prospects, developments in housing markets, creditworthiness of borrowers, to name a few', 'The monitoring involves processing large amounts of (often disparate) information of a statistical nature and is based on market sources', 'In addition, continuous market intelligence efforts are essential for effective risk monitoring and the early detection of new financial instruments, practices or business strategies which could create vulnerabilities and risks in financial markets', 'In the case of the Risk Board, market intelligence will be complemented by what could be called ‘institutional intelligence’ and ‘policy intelligence’, given the qualitative information and expert knowledge available to central banks and supervisory authorities represented in the ESRB', 'The Board’s independent, impartial status could prove to be invaluable in the surveillance and identification of risks viewed as material', 'Risk monitoring is facilitated by a large set of tools, including contemporaneous financial stability indicators and forward-looking early warning indicators and models', 'These tools need to be regularly revised and updated in order to capture innovation in financial markets, fuelled by new products and business models', 'Macro-prudential indicators comprise a vast set of indicators – on the macroeconomic environment, financial markets, financial institutions and financial system infrastructures', 'More specifically, they include macroeconomic aspects, financing conditions, monetary conditions, asset valuations, risk appetite, market liquidity, funding liquidity, credit risk, financial strength of institutions, and others', 'Some of these indicators may contain information relevant to early warnings as they may draw attention to rapidly increasing exposures to specific asset classes, broad-based increases in financial leverage and dynamics in the maturity profile of financial institutions’ debt which could indicate roll-over problems', '[12]  In the ESRB context, early warning indicators and early warning signal (EWS) models should play an important role in both the risk surveillance phase and in the lead-up to the risk warning phase', 'EWS models are designed to indicate when a financial system, market or intermediary reaches a ‘danger zone’, which usually points to a crisis ahead', 'In the past, a number of forward-looking stability indicators were used by most central banks, but these were not necessarily comprehensive frameworks of developed EWS models covering most financial systems', 'One reason for this may have been that the older generation of these models performed well in the sample but they typically failed to predict future crises', 'Recent research suggests that their out-of-sample performance can be improved, in particular with respect to credit cycles and asset price bubbles', '[13] A caveat that remains is that it seems difficult for them to improve their predictions on the timing of credit booms and asset-bubble bursting', 'Risk assessment     Risk assessment relates to the evaluation of the relevance and potential severity of each risk identified as material in the surveillance phase', 'It should therefore include a quantitative evaluation of the likelihood that the potential risk scenarios could actually materialise, as well as an evaluation of the ability of the financial system to absorb the shocks (for example, through existing capital buffers or through the potential to increase buffers in the future through profit retention)', 'It should also include cost estimates in terms of the failure of institutions, costs deriving from the malfunctioning of financial markets or impairment of the real economy', 'The product of these factors forms the basis for the ranking of risks', 'Quantitative methods and analytical tools (for example, macro-stress testing models) should support, together with expert judgement, the prioritising or ranking of these risks', 'The models will help in the conduct of quantitative impact assessments on the financial sector as well as in the assessment of the potential costs for the real economy, and thereby offer information about the relevance and severity of the risks detected in the surveillance phase', 'Macro-stress testing models have become the workhorse of macro-prudential stability analysis in the last decade, notably including quantitative impact studies for specific scenarios', 'Their main purpose is to assess the resilience of the banking and financial systems against extreme but still plausible events', 'One problem with these models in the past was that even for large shocks they generated hardly any bank failures', 'This can probably be improved by using appropriate data, more granular than previously available, and by capturing better and a larger number of adverse feedback loops that can play a role in amplifying the transmission of instability in the financial system', 'These feedback loops could include contagion effects across banks, market liquidity and funding liquidity problems', '[14] Another difficulty for these models is whether they should be extended to also capture feedbacks from real economy outcomes to financial stability variables', 'The assessment task is currently much less developed than the surveillance one', 'This is not only because it involves considerable analytical sophistication, but also and mainly because there are significant gaps in the information on the financial intermediaries themselves and on inter-linkages between the various parts of the financial system', 'Viewing the financial system as a network, more information is needed on the key network nodes, and well as on the links between those nodes', '[15] The degree of interconnectedness in the system may be determined by common exposures to specific asset classes, such as specific sectors in the economy, for example, commercial property, or to specific regions such as emerging Europe, via granted loans or securities holdings', 'Inter-linkages may also derive from intra-bank and intra-group exposure, as well as from trading and other correlated positions in the financial markets, such as in the credit derivatives market, which may lead to crowded trades, should they need to be unwound simultaneously', 'They may derive from cross-ownerships and capital participations among institutions, from similarities in business models, or from reliance on the same external sources for funding, for example', 'While it is unrealistic to think that it would be possible to characterise the degree of interconnectedness of the financial system by taking into account all possible channels for contagion, a great deal of invaluable information exists in a scattered form (at the disposal of supervisors, trading platforms or the institutions themselves)', 'At present, these information gaps imply that most modelling techniques for risk assessment, including macro stress-testing and contagion models, are highly dependent on market-inferred data based on stock prices or credit default swap spreads that, in particular, might not behave reliably at times of turmoil or stress in financial markets', 'It is important to note that the complexities of systemic risk and macro-prudential supervision and the state of current research do not allow the analytical tool kit to be limited to just one or two major models', 'Given that the framework for macro-prudential analysis is at an early stage of development compared with other areas of economics, there is a need to look at a wider range of models and thereby include relevant risks, imbalances and transmission channels', 'Systemic risk analysis needs to be supported by a suite of state-of-the-art analytical models and tools, and a conceptual framework for using them', 'The complex and intertwined economic and financial linkages call for a constant cross-checking of several indicators or measures', 'In addition, the evolving nature of finance and the pace of innovation also require that the set of tools for systemic risk detection and assessment are constantly adjusted or revised', 'Many central banks, including the ECB, have in the past developed such models and tools in order to support their regular financial stability analyses and reports', 'The experiences with the crisis and the decision to establish a macro-prudential stability function in Europe suggest that, even when building on existing structures, significant efforts are called for in order to extend and further improve models and tools', 'While it would be desirable for the risk assessment exercise to be increasingly quantitative, it should never become mechanistic or fully model-based', 'Expert judgement and qualitative assessments will always be crucial to understand the messages coming from various analytical tools, also taking into account overall intelligence efforts', 'Comprehensive information base    Irrespective of their level of sophistication, models need to be fed with the appropriate data in order to produce results that, in addition to their analytical interest, can support policy messages', 'A comprehensive information base is also key in the risk surveillance phase that precedes the actual risk assessment', 'This is because the establishment of a wide radar screen supporting rigorous monitoring is only possible if the critical information is available', 'The current crisis has convincingly shown that a significant part of credit intermediation was channelled outside the banking sector and the regulated financial sector', 'The non-regulated or ‘shadow’ banking system was almost totally off any surveillance radar screen', 'Not enough was known about special investment vehicles, conduits, securitisation markets and instruments, or about all the financial intermediation that takes place outside the traditional banking system', 'Moreover, little was known about the direct and indirect exposures between this shadow banking system and the regulated one, which turned out to be substantial', 'Information on non-banking institutions, potentially of systemic importance, such as hedge funds, was scattered, not quality-checked and typically provided on a voluntary basis', 'A tendency to create a bias towards the best performers was the result', 'Even for the banking sector, for which data is abundant – and, what’s more, there is substantial expertise in conducting risk assessments – the information available to bodies entrusted with financial stability functions but without a supervisory mandate is far from satisfactory', 'The information on the degree of interconnectedness that I previously mentioned is critical, even if only to identify the key nodes of the financial system network which would need to be closely monitored', 'So far, for the case of the ECB, systemic risk analysis is conducted solely on the basis of publicly available information, mostly gathered from individual financial reporting', 'The failure of Lehman Brothers just over a year ago illustrates well the relevance of such inter-linkages between financial institutions', 'They may matter more than the size of their balance sheets', 'And if those linkages are impaired, they can affect the functioning of the entire financial system', 'In fact, before the crisis an increasing amount of overall risk in the economy was perceived to exist, but there was little certainty as to where the risks lay', 'Few suspected that the vast majority of them would be held directly or indirectly at key nodes of the financial system network', 'The spectacular growth in the securitisation and credit risk transfer market in the years up to the crisis increased discussion of the potential vulnerabilities, in particular about who were the ultimate holders of the risks originating in the banking system, and their capacity to withstand shocks', 'These risks were transferred from the originators to various investors outside the banking sector, from institutional investors to hedge funds, but also within the banking sector itself', 'In fact, weaknesses in the so-called originate-to-distribute model followed by most large banks, and fragilities in the funding of special investment vehicles and conduits resulted in some of those risks backfiring and ending up consolidated on the banks’ balance sheets', 'The eruption of the turmoil left banks sitting on unwanted risks, such as leveraged loans related to leveraged-buy-out transactions, (often referred to as warehousing risk in the financial jargon), which were intended to be sold on to the market', 'Likewise, in the structuring of collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), which were an extremely profitable business for banks in the years before summer 2007, the banking system ended up accumulating a considerable proportion of CDO tranches', 'As the crisis broke, these tranches rapidly became a significant fraction of banks’ impaired or so-called toxic assets', 'Risk warnings    Let’s get back to the European Systemic Risk Board', 'In addition to risk surveillance and risk assessment, the ESRB will be entrusted with a third task – issuing risk warnings and policy recommendations', 'This is somewhat new to the central banking community', 'The issuance of risk warnings, in the context of safeguarding financial stability – where the analysis is centred on the downside risks and thus on highly improbable events – differs substantially from other types of analysis focused on a central, most probable, baseline scenario (such as the one supporting monetary policy)', 'The translation of systemic risk assessments into proposals for concrete policy actions – of a prudential or supervisory nature – is also, to a large extent, new to the central banking community', '3', 'What went wrong', 'Confronted with the question of whether central banks and international bodies with financial stability competencies saw the financial crisis coming, it would be fair to answer “Yes, to some extent”', 'Prior to the summer of 2007, in a number of official publications [16], attention was drawn to a number of growing vulnerabilities and potential risks such as:     the (then incipient) crisis in the US sub-prime mortgage market and its potential to deepen and spread to other markets;   the fact that financial market liquidity could vanish abruptly when investor uncertainty and risk aversion rose;    the role of hedge funds as key players, over the years, in fuelling liquidity in financial markets, implying that a shock to the hedge fund industry would severely affect the smooth functioning of some markets;   the excessive reliance of investors on the risk assessment of structured products made by rating agencies;   the concentration of risks in the financial system, which was becoming increasingly difficult to identify due to the proliferation of structured finance products and credit risk transfer instruments;   the risk-bearing ability of the ultimate risk-holders in these chains', 'However, it would be fair to say that few, if any – including market participants and public authorities – were able to foresee the magnitude and severity of the crisis', 'In retrospect, it became clear that the crisis was greatly intensified by a myriad of unknown connections and interdependencies between financial intermediaries, within and outside the banking system, including some non-regulated financial sectors', 'Sophisticated market participants and investors were also apparently unaware of the degree of interconnectedness in the financial system', 'Otherwise, their behaviour in the months leading up to the summer of 2007 might have shown some anticipation of the developments (e', 'g', 'they might have seized some contrarian investment opportunities)', 'In particular,     the magnitude of the large off-balance-sheet exposures of banks to the US sub-prime-related structured finance products was widely unknown;   little information existed about the extent and implications of the activities of new financial entities – conduits and other structured investment vehicles – which are linked through management and liquidity arrangements to banks;   the probability that the various intertwined vulnerabilities could materialise simultaneously and combine in the way they eventually did was perceived as being very close to zero;   the extent of inter-linkages between financial intermediaries and across markets was not fully appreciated, and the possibility of tensions in one specific segment of the credit market spreading rapidly to other markets and continents was not foreseen', 'For more than two years now, we have been discussing the need for major improvements in supervisory and regulatory frameworks to respond to the weaknesses that came to light as the crisis unfolded', 'I will not address these issues again today', 'I will approach the question from the point of view of central banks and ask: what influenced their ability to raise market awareness with respect to building vulnerabilities within the financial system', 'And can we rely on the ESRB to repair this problem in the future', 'The information at the disposal of central banks and other bodies with financial stability competencies enabled them to point to growing risks and vulnerabilities, but it did not allow a deeper understanding of the interconnections in the financial system and of the potential magnitude of the detected risks', 'As a result, the discussion of the risks in their public communications or publications tended to be mostly of a qualitative nature, and generally did not involve a clear risk prioritisation exercise, and therefore had a potentially smaller impact on market behaviour', 'Another important element was that risk assessments were generally not made with the specific aim of suggesting appropriate remedial policy actions in terms of prudential policies or regulation', 'Recommendations, mostly formulated in broad terms, tended to target market participants’ behaviour (e', 'g', 'proposing mitigating actions), but they were more muted regarding policy measures that could be taken in the prudential and regulatory area', 'One reason for this is, again, the information base', 'The formulation of concrete policy recommendations (e', 'g', 'with respect to capital buffers or funding-related issues) would need to be backed by rigorous quantitative assessments, for which publicly available information is generally not sufficient', 'Along the same lines, and perhaps as a result of the deficient information base, very limited research and analytical efforts have been pooled in the central banking community with a view to supporting policy suggestions in the prudential and regulatory area', '4', 'Turning the clock back    But let me turn the question around and ask: what if the Risk Board had existed in 2006-07', 'Would this have prevented the financial crisis', 'This is a difficult question because the modus operandi of the ESRB is still to be defined', 'It is also difficult to know whether the agreed framework and operational processes will prove to be effective', 'However, if the ESRB is given the appropriate information base, if it combines central banking and supervisory expertise and is supported by a sound analytical framework and can produce solid risk assessments and policy recommendations, the answer should be positive', 'Policy-makers, regulators, academics and market participants have learnt an enormous amount from the crisis', 'As the turmoil spread, they learnt about the functioning of the financial system and the links between the financial system and the real sector', 'In particular, the crisis highlighted the importance of the shadow banking system in fuelling credit into the economy, of indirect links between the banking and insurance sectors, as well as of fragilities in the securitisation market, just to name a few', 'However, it seems appropriate to ask: would a pre-crisis ESRB have closely monitored the Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) markets', 'Would it have been fully aware of conduits and special investment vehicles (SIVs)', 'Against this background, the financial crisis has triggered a number of initiatives to improve the monitoring of the shadow banking system', 'These include calls for mandatory reporting by financial institutions (e', 'g', 'hedge funds with significant volumes of assets under management) as well as the reporting of amendments to the accounting treatment of conduits and SIVs to ensure greater transparency with respect to links to sponsors, for example', 'These initiatives are expected to contribute to a better coverage of the non-regulated financial sector, coupled with a greater awareness of the business models and topics that were overlooked in the past', 'This information would not have been available to a pre-crisis ESRB', 'The crisis has also stressed the importance of developing ways to measure systemic risk, as it clearly showed that – both for market participants and regulators – without proper measurement there can be no proper management', 'A comprehensive strand of work relating to complementary measures of risk, capturing elements of leverage, liquidity, correlation of positions, concentration of exposures, has been initiated both by the private and public sectors', 'Prior to the summer of 2007, there was less emphasis on the need for targeted and adequate measurement of variables, including a critical stance on systemic risk, for supervisory and financial stability purposes', 'The crisis has also shown that firm-level data on financial intermediaries, including of a supervisory nature, might be critical to identify institutions of potential systemic relevance that warrant closer monitoring and to understand interdependencies among firms and markets – interdependencies which, if impaired, could have a strong impact on the overall stability of the financial system', 'The key data requirements relate to: i) the possibility of joint failures of institutions resulting from their common exposures at a single point in time (these exposures could derive from shocks that come from outside the financial system or inter-linkages among intermediaries), and ii) the fact that, over time, the dynamics of the financial system and of the real economy reinforce each other, increasing the amplitude of booms and busts, and undermining stability in both the financial sector and the real economy', 'The financial crisis has shown that monitoring aggregate data is insufficient and may not accurately indicate the vulnerabilities hidden in the financial system and that there is the need to link micro data to macroeconomic risks', 'As such, firm-level data (as opposed to, for example, estimates based on country or sector aggregates) have been recognised as essential for more accurate assessments of the potential impact of risks materialising, e', 'g', 'estimating the amount of losses for the financial sector, as well as for conducting system-wide stress testing, contagion analysis, or the assessment of feedback loops between the real and financial sectors', 'In the pre-turmoil period, supervisory authorities were more concerned about overburdening institutions with reporting requirements than with enforcing adequate disclosure', 'As such, an ESRB established before the summer of 2007, but with access to the same information base as the one available to central banks at the time, might not have made substantially different systemic risk assessments', 'In addition to the importance of having a more comprehensive information base, the crisis has led to a significant revamping of research into systemic risk and to greater input into the formulation of related policy recommendations', 'As I just mentioned, in addition to improvements in macro stress-testing techniques and the early warning signal literature, more attention is being paid to contagion and spill-over models, especially for the banking sector, to macro-financial risk-based flow-of-funds approach using contingent claims analysis, and to research tools to support regulatory and supervisory policy recommendations', 'One area in which a pre-crisis ESRB could have made a difference is in the conduct of country-specific analysis', 'Generally, ECB financial stability assessments focus on the euro area as a whole and rarely make distinctions between euro area countries', 'They mainly consider the risks and vulnerabilities common to most euro area countries; there is little analysis, let alone formulation, of policy recommendations, at country level', 'While this helps to distil the elements of the analysis relevant to the euro zone, country-specific vulnerabilities might end up receiving insufficient attention', 'The ESRB will have a clear mandate to pursue country analysis and to provide country-specific policy recommendations if deemed necessary', 'If a task of this kind had been carried out by an independent and impartial body before the crisis, it could have signalled growing vulnerabilities in EU countries', 'Risk warnings about fragilities related to foreign currency lending, about particularly highly leveraged sectors in some countries, or overvaluation in a number of EU housing markets could have been louder', 'I would add, though, that none of these elements triggered the financial crisis – rather, they intensified it as the crisis spread to the EU financial system', 'The crisis also calls for improved coordination and cooperation between the international bodies responsible for safeguarding financial stability at all levels of the analysis', 'Cooperation between the ESRB, the Financial Stability Board and the IMF, for example, will probably be fruitful in the future, helping to raise awareness of growing vulnerabilities at global level that could not surface as prominently in an EU-focused financial stability surveillance exercise', 'Cooperation in the risk detection and risk assessment tasks would involve, for example, sharing of technical expertise and of findings from market and policy intelligence efforts', 'In addition, the ESRB may use these international bodies as a sounding board for its risk assessments, risk warnings and policy recommendations', 'An ESRB with an EU-wide focus established prior to the summer of 2007 would not have had access to the stepped-up co-operation at global level or to the wealth of information and analysis on the global environment that should be at its disposal as soon as it starts functioning in 2010', 'Final remarks    While the ESRB has a better chance of achieving its mandate now than it would have had earlier this decade, its tasks will be difficult and its challenges considerable', 'In particular regarding the issuance of risk warnings, the credibility of the ESRB will rest upon the minimisation and balancing of so-called type I errors and type II errors', 'Type I errors entail the possibility of identifying those risks that subsequently do not materialise, while type II errors relate to the possibility of failing to identify risks that subsequently do materialise', 'Identifying a long list of potential systemic risks to financial stability could minimise the probability of making type II errors but may lead to accusations of “crying wolf”', 'The opposite could lead to an important risk to the EU financial system being overlooked, which if it materialised, could harm the ESRB’s reputation', 'Both the rigour of the checks for potential sources of risk and vulnerability, and the quality of the risk assessments (based on the information made available to the ESRB) should have a substantive influence on the credibility and effectiveness of the Board’s work', 'Addressing the type I-type II error trade-off by selecting which risks merit risk warnings can only be done by combining a comprehensive and strict monitoring of all potential sources of risk with a well-informed and detailed risk assessment', 'Expertise in the analysis of financial sector issues, market and public intelligence provided by the EU authorities represented in the ESRB will be considered invaluable', 'However, assessments of a qualitative nature should, to the extent possible, be complemented by quantitative impact assessments, which will also facilitate the task of prioritising the risks and the decision to issue risk warnings', 'In short, if the European Systemic Risk Board is to really strengthen macro-prudential supervision in Europe, four conditions need to be fulfilled', 'First, a clear legislative framework must be created to underpin the work of the ESRB and the supporting role of the ECB', 'It should be noted that last June the European Council clearly indicated that the ECB should provide the secretarial, logistical, administrative and analytical support to the ESRB', 'Second, all parties involved in the preparation of ESRB risk assessments and potential risk warnings need to do the necessary analysis and research to bring our understanding of systemic risk and macro-prudential regulation to a new level, and to find common languages and frameworks', 'Third, in addition to improving the analytical tools supporting risk surveillance and risk assessment, more detailed and accurate information – to back up ESRB risk warnings – is essential', 'It should include better data coverage of non-regulated financial sectors, as well as more granular information on key node-institutions in the financial system and on potential inter-linkages between them', 'The ability to formulate concrete policy recommendations, as opposed to general recommendations, depends greatly on access to critical information', 'Finally, risk warnings and recommendations made by the ESRB have to be translated into concrete action, in particular by the national supervisory authorities', 'To conclude, the European Systemic Risk Board can be compared to a doctor who examines a patient, asking him about his ailment and suggesting that some tests be done', 'The doctor then makes a diagnosis and eventually recommends some medicines', 'It’s up to the patient to abide by the doctor’s recommendation', 'The doctor is not in a position to take direct action', 'He is not allowed to intervene, even when things get really bad, as in the case of a risk of contagion and the patient has to be put in quarantine', 'He might be the best doctor in the world, but his treatment will only be as good as the quality and completeness of the patient’s replies – and the patient’s willingness to take the medicines prescribed', 'This is the way in which the ESRB has been constructed in Europe', 'Its success will largely depend on the compliance of its ‘patients’, who hopefully have learned the lessons of this crisis', 'Thank you for your attention', '[1] I would like to thank L',

      " list(['Towards the Banking Union   Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB,at the 2nd FIN-FSA Conference on EU Regulation and Supervision “Banking and Supervision under Transformation” organised by the Financial Supervisory Authority,Helsinki,12 February 2013 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be here today and I am grateful to the organizers for having invited me', 'All of us have been reflecting on the lessons to be drawn from the crisis relevant for the European project and in particular the ones related to the monetary union', 'The initial choice for monetary union was to have a minimalist framework: the adoption of a single currency plus a fiscal brake, the Stability and Growth Pact, to ensure stability, exclude free riders and help the single monetary policy', 'All other policies, economic or concerning financial stability like supervision, were left for the national level', 'It was assumed, in line with the economic thinking of the time, that monetary integration would spontaneously foster the synchronisation of the economic cycle and that national “shock-absorber” would be sufficient to deal with country specific developments', 'The crisis has made it clear that a highly interconnected and integrated area such as the euro area, requires a stronger institutional framework', 'An important element to strengthen the financial institutional framework is the creation of the Banking Union', 'The Council proposal on the Single Supervisory Mechanism of last December is testimony to the urgency in setting up a basic pillar of the Banking Union', 'A strong and independent supranational supervisor will contribute in a significant manner to the smooth functioning of the monetary union and to restore confidence in the banking sector', 'The regaining of confidence in the banking sector is key to reverse recent developments towards financial fragmentation and help restart a well-functioning interbank market', 'My intervention today is divided into two parts', 'In the first part I will touch upon the different elements of the Banking Union and reflect upon the underlying rationale for its establishment', 'In the second part of my speech I will focus on the SSM by reviewing its main features as well as the immediate challenges for the ECB to prepare itself to assume its supervisory task', 'Part I – The Banking Union  The key building blocks of a Banking Union The Banking Union aims at building an integrated financial framework to safeguard financial stability and minimise the cost of bank failures', 'As we all know, it consists of five complementary building blocks, of which the SSM forms an integral part', 'The first block is the establishment of a single rulebook, which in a substantial way exists already', 'The European Banking Authority (EBA) has the legal competence to monitor its implementation The addition of the CRD IV, the Resolution and Deposit Guarantee harmonisation Directives will lead to the creation of a single rulebook that will significantly contribute towards creating a level playing field', 'Likewise, the SSM will also contribute to reinforce the single rulebook, as a European dimension will be provided to the way supervision is conducted', 'The establishment of a EU framework for single supervision forms the second element of the Banking Union and will be at the centre of my talk today', 'The SSM will be a mechanism, composed of national competent authorities and the ECB, with the possibility of non-euro area Member States to participate', 'The process to establish the SSM is underway, with the Council proposal forming the basis for the current discussion at the European Parliament', 'We at the ECB are quite pleased with the Council’s proposal which is being assessed by the European Parliament', 'In all my comments I will refer it as it corresponds to the current basis for the future SSM', 'A third element of the Banking Union is the establishment of a Single Resolution Mechanism', 'An important pre-condition is a swift adoption of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, as it lays out a harmonised toolbox of resolution powers', 'The Single Resolution Mechanism would build on the measures and tools laid down in the Directive, particularly by providing a robust framework that allows for prompt and coordinated resolution action, specifically where cross-border banks are concerned', 'As we all know, the swift and orderly resolution of cross-border banks is the Achilles heel that needs to be addressed', 'The framework for the Single Resolution Mechanism is still to be defined and I look forward to the Commission’s upcoming legislative proposal', 'Let me nevertheless highlight the main features that in my view such a Mechanism should have', 'It would have the same institutional and geographical scope as the SSM', 'The SRM would be an operationally decentralised system, where the ultimate responsibility rests with a Single Resolution Authority', 'The Single Resolution Authority would be at its centre, govern the resolution of banks and coordinate the application of resolution tools', 'It should have a comprehensive set of enforceable tools, powers and authority to resolve all banks in the SSM', 'In particular it would ensure that failing banks are resolved swiftly, through impartial decision-making focused on the European dimension', 'The timely resolution of banks should avoid the cascading of problems from one bank to other banks, thereby affecting European financial stability', 'In order for the Single Resolution Mechanism to be perceived as credible, it should have sufficient funding', 'I am not talking about bailing-out banks with public money', 'Resolution is about resolving the situation of banks that have attained the point of non-viability and about doing it in a way that minimises the involvement of public money', 'First, the writing-down of capital instruments and bailing-in of creditors should be fully exploited', 'Second, funds accumulated in a European Resolution Fund should be used to provide additional funding needed to realise a least-cost resolution strategy', 'These contributions should be risk-based and collected ex-ante from all banks participating in the SRM', 'Third, as a last resort, if the resources of the European Resolution Fund do not suffice, funds could be drawn from a European-level fiscal backstop mechanism', 'However, any fiscal support to the SRM should come in the form of credit to the European Resolution Fund', 'The Fund would need to repay the loan through additional levies on the banks under the SRM according to pre-specified rules', 'This should ensure that the mechanism is fiscally neutral over the medium term', 'Resolution activity may require the temporary use of public money if the Resolution Fund would not have enough resources, for instance, to capitalise a bridge bank that is sold later on to the private sector thus recovering the capital involved', 'In the US this is ensured by the existence of Treasury credit line, limited to 50bn dollars that can be drawn upon by the FDIC and later repaid', 'The existence of this financial backstop can be considered as the fourth element of a complete banking union, especially because, as announced by the European Summit, there will be the possibility of direct capitalisation of banks by European funds', 'This element, whatever its terms, will be of great important for the achievement of one goal of the banking union project, namely to mitigate the negative feedback loop between banks and sovereigns', 'Finally, the fifth element of the Banking Union will be the establishment of a common system of deposit protection', 'A first step in this direction will be the adoption of the legislative proposal on deposit guarantee schemes, providing a harmonised framework', 'This framework should ensure depositor confidence and enable the national deposit guarantee schemes, built on common EU standards, to interact with the SRM', 'A European deposit guarantee scheme is therefore not essential in the short term', 'Nevertheless, a common system, built on common EU standards, will be important in the future to ensure enhanced depositor confidence in the robustness of all European banks', 'This element would also contribute to reduce the risks of financial fragmentation that results from contagion fears and is detrimental to the smoothing functioning of the single monetary policy', 'Rationale for a Banking Union I see the Banking Union as essential to sustain and strengthen the EMU framework', 'It is worthwhile to dwell upon the reasons why I consider it so', 'After all, the nature and features of banking union must be strictly connected with what justifies its existence', 'First, a single supervisory mechanism is necessary because of the increasing interconnectedness between financial institutions and markets across the euro area over the past decade, be it through internationally active banking groups, bilateral trading exposures, or presence in the same market segments', 'The recent financial crisis demonstrated how quickly and powerfully problems in the financial sector of one country can spread to another', 'This is especially the case in a monetary union', 'As a result, problems in the banking sector might originate at the national level, but are more and more likely to affect other countries of the euro area as well, and may quickly threaten the stability of the entire euro area banking system', 'Such developments and the underlying financial structures can best be assessed by a central authority rather than through cooperation between national ones', '[1]  This has been captured by the so-called ‘financial trilemma’', 'The concept of the trilemma is adapted from the famous ’monetary trilemma’ on the impossibility of simultaneously achieving three objectives: a fixed exchange rate, capital mobility, and national monetary policy', '[2] In a very similar way, but applied to international finance, as put forward by Dirk Schoenmaker (2011) following a model by Xavier Freixas (2003) [3] the ‘financial trilemma’ illustrates the impossibility of achieving three objectives in an environment with globalized financial markets: financial stability, financial integration and national financial policies, especially supervision', 'For instance, the financial stability objective could possibly be pursued with national financial policies and supervision but only at the expense of further integration', 'The resulting fragmentation of the single market is however clearly at odds with the EMU framework and the requirements of the single monetary policy', 'Similarly, financial stability cannot be safeguarded as financial integration progresses (with an ever greater degree of interconnectedness between financial institutions and markets) and financial sector policies remain a strict national competence', 'Pursuing financial stability and integration as joint objectives requires true European level policies', 'This is particularly illustrated in a ECB working paper by Holthausen and Ronde (2004) [4] showing that with increasing financial integration, pursuing national financial policies will generally not lead to financial stability, because national policies seek to benefit national welfare, while not taking into account externalities of their supervisory practices on other countries', 'This leads to an under-provision of financial stability as a public good', 'From a different perspective, Goodhart and Schoenmaker (2009) [5] show, both in a model and using European data, that a coordination failure emerges when ex-post coordination among different national supervisors leads to an underprovision recapitalisation of cross-border banks after a banking problem', 'A lesson of the trilemma is, therefore, that it is beneficial for the provision of financial stability to replace national policies with policies at the supranational level, thus geographically aligning supervisory incentives with the effect such supervision has on the financial sector as a whole', 'Other welfare enhancing benefits will come from the reduction of reporting costs for international banks, the easier centralised management of liquidity and the improving of the overall management of risks', 'The materialisation of all these benefits will depend, however, on a vital condition for the functioning of the SSM, namely that it ensures a truly unified European perspective and does not act as a sort of an inter-governmental body of national supervisors', 'The elimination of any possible national bias implies that it has to function really as one system with a strong center and this will be its greatest challenge', 'A second reason that justifies the banking union project regards the requirements for a smooth functioning of the single monetary policy', 'Its transmission mechanism across all member countries of the euro area requires an appropriate level of financial integration that ensures well performing cross border money markets', 'After a spectacular integration of money and financial in the first 10 years of monetary union we have observed increasing fragmentation that only recently, after the creation of our OMT programme, started to abate', 'This fragmentation has impaired the transmission mechanism of monetary policy', 'It has, of course, several different causes but could have been mitigated in the first place if some elements of a banking union had been in place', 'This would have contributed to a stronger separation between sovereign and banks by creating enhanced confidence in the national banking sectors´ solvency and liquidity situations', 'This would happen not only as a result of an effective overall supervision but also would stem from the elimination of ring-fencing practices condoned or even incentivised by some national regulators', 'The elimination or mitigation of the banks and sovereigns negative feedback loops will then be promoted by several elements of the banking union acting together: the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the Single Resolution Mechanism and the European direct recapitalisation of banks', 'The third reason that justifies the banking union project has to do with the development of large financial imbalances within the euro area in both public and private sectors', 'In particular, the development of macro and external imbalances was significantly driven by private sector indebtness, proving that the fiscal brake was not enough to guarantee macro stability and excessive heterogeneity among member states', 'This provided the rationale for the recent creation of a formal Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure to monitor and promote timely policy measures to avoid the building up of macroeconomic instability in member states', 'This was in part because fiscal rules were implemented weakly, not applied rigorously and subsequently watered down', 'Some countries therefore ran persistent deficits in good times or maintained high levels of debt', 'But the greater imbalances in fact emerged in the private sector', 'Between 1999 and 2007, the ratio of public debt to GDP in EMU declined on average by 5', '6 percentage points', 'But in the same period, the ratio of private sector debt to GDP increased by 26', '8 percentage points', 'For the same period, in the stressed countries, the cumulative increase in the private debt ratio to GDP versus the public debt ratio, amounted respectively, to 49 and 24 per cent for Portugal, 75 and minus 35 per cent for Spain, 101 and minus 10 per cent for Ireland, 217 and 4 per cent for Greece', 'In 2007, just before the crisis started, the level of public debt on average in the euro area was 73% but was 63% in Portugal, 46% in Spain and 26% in Ireland', 'Private debt levels were able to increase so significantly because the integration of national markets allowed for higher borrowing from abroad and increased leverage', 'Banks were at the centre of this process both in lending and borrowing countries', 'As we now know, these flows were not perfectly optimised by rational private agents', 'The minimalist institutional construction of the euro area lacked the tools to discourage these developments', 'The official bodies that could – and perhaps should – have intervened more to prevent these developments were national supervisors both in lending and borrowing countries', 'Yet they lacked the perspective to do so and also the instruments to contain private capital flows that were considered to result from optimizing self-equilibrating markets', 'Only macro-prudential measures agreed through a consensus at the European level could have dealt with the situation', 'In other words, there was a mismatch between the degree of integration and the scope of governance', 'In retrospect, the euro area was not prepared to deal with the build-up of systemic risks', 'This was in a large part the result of two features of the dominant economic thinking at the time:  - first that the private sector is essentially stable and self- correcting composed of fully rational agents always optimizing inter-temporally with knowledge of the future probability distributions to infinity of economic returns and variables', 'In such a world no defaults are admitted or dangerous bubbles possible', 'Only the public sector can create instability', 'The Stability Pact was then supposed to be enough to ensure stability', '- second, that finance does not matter for real economy fluctuations', 'After the Real Business Cycles school, the rational expectations hypothesis and the intertemporal optimization paradigm, money and finance were considered not relevant anymore', 'Money crept back in the new consensual macro model through the introduction of wage and price rigidities, allowing for short-term real economy effects of monetary policy', 'On the contrary, finance continued to be invisible with the Efficient Market Hypothesis ensuring a reliable plumbing of the real economy', 'Banks and capital markets were not considered endogenous sources of instabilities with real economy effects', 'They were absent from macroeconomic models', 'All these features are being corrected, both in economic theory and models and in institutions', 'The important consequence for the monetary union framework is the launching of the banking union project and within its supervision component the attribution to the SSM of macroprudential policy instruments', 'Previously, the ESRB had been created only with the competence to issue warnings and recommendations', 'Economic theory and the overwhelming evidence of the importance of systemic risk in the crisis explain why the ECB insisted from the beginning that concrete macroprudential instruments were given to the SSM', 'The participant countries in the mechanism, which also can use those instruments, can feel more reassured that systemic risk at the European level will be better addressed in the future', 'Part II – The Single Supervisory Mechanism  Main features of the SSM Regulation The Single Supervisory Mechanism is to become operational in 2014', 'Let me briefly highlight its main features some of which are related with the previous analysis', 'SSM as one system  The SSM will operate as a system, catering for all expertise of national supervisors and at the same time possessing a strong decision-making centre', 'As I mentioned before, this is an important feature necessary for the effectiveness of the new entity', 'Appropriate decentralisation procedures will need to be defined while preserving the unity of the supervisory system and avoiding duplication', 'To ensure a strong centre, the ECB’s final responsibility for supervision within the SSM is matched by control powers over the system as a whole, as well as by very close cooperation arrangements with national authorities', 'The first aspect in the draft Regulation approved by the Council that ensures that the intention is indeed to create one system of European supervision results from the legal competence given to the ECB over all the banks in the participating countries', 'Naturally at the centre of the system, the ECB could not directly supervise all the thousands of existing banks', 'Only the more significant banks will be subject to that direct supervision', 'All the others will continue to be supervised by the competent national authorities', 'The SSM is more than just the ECB and includes all the national supervisors and central banks and so will have to function in a much decentralised way', 'Decentralisation does not mean fragmentation', 'What makes the SSM work truly as one system, besides the legal competence over all the banks, are some other main features: First, all the components of the system will have to act in accordance with a system of guidelines, ECB specific regulations and manuals of supervisory practices that will be approved at the center by the Supervisory Board', 'The respect for these rules will be monitored and subjected to peer reviews', 'Second, the center at the ECB will receive all the supervisory data, regarding all the banks Third, the bodies at the center of the system, at the ECB, have the power to transfer to direct supervision any bank or group of banks that may be considered relevant and may be the origin of systemic risk', 'As we know from the crisis not only big banks may the source of more general financial instability', 'This legal competence is also an important persuasive tool to ensure harmonised supervisory practices throughout the system', 'Extensive powers of the SSM A second important feature of the SSM regards its extensive powers in the conduct of its supervisory function', 'The SSM, with the ECB at its centre, is entrusted with an extensive set of micro- and macro- prudential powers, covering all key tasks relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions', 'This broad array of tasks and powers is crucial, as it is the foundation for the SSM to effectively supervise banks', 'In concrete, the micro-prudential tasks range from the authorisation of credit institutions to having the power to carry out early intervention when a bank is in financial distress', 'These tasks are matched with a broad set of powers to carry them out', 'In this context, the ECB may conduct all necessary investigations and on-site inspections and obtain all necessary information to carry out its task effectively', 'In addition, in order to enforce its decisions and rules, the ECB also avails of sanctioning powers', 'Beyond all these aspects that are usual in respect to supervisory authorities, there are two other points I would like to underline', 'The first refers to the so-called early intervention powers as they are foreseen in the draft Directive about bank resolution that should be approved in the near future and long before the SSM will start operating', 'These early intervention are vast in what concerns the governance and scope of activity of institutions that start to have problems that can lead them to a point of non-viability', 'As such, these powers are related to what is usually called “prompt corrective action” regarding problematic banks and can be applied before the bank is delivered to the Resolution Authority', 'Another important competence conferred upon the ECB as the centre of the SSM concern the macro-prudential instruments to be possibly applied both to the euro-area financial system as a whole or to individual countries', 'These powers are shared with national authorities that can also take measures in this field but it is nevertheless another essential element of the proposal', 'The crisis has shown that supervising the micro-prudential risks at individual banks separately is not sufficient and that macro- and micro- risks can actually be mutually reinforcing', 'Involvement of non-euro area Member States A third important feature of the SSM relates to the preservation and deepening of the Single Market, particularly the fact that national competent authorities of non-euro area Member States have an option to participate in the SSM', 'They can participate through establishing a close cooperation with the ECB', 'By giving non-euro area Member States full membership and voting rights in the Supervisory Body, the body responsible for the preparation of decisions on supervisory matters, they are placed on an equal footing with euro-area Member States', 'However, as the ECB Governing Council is the ultimate the decision-making body of the ECB, its role in the SSM is reduced to the possibility of accepting of accepting or rejecting the decisions of the Supervisory Board', 'At the same time, a system integrating a mediation panel is foreseen in the Regulation in case of divergences that may involve a non-euro area Member State', 'All these mechanisms were accepted at the level of the Council by all governments which seems to indicate that we might see an extension of the SSM well beyond the euro area', 'Separation of monetary and supervisory functions, while benefiting from synergies  A final feature of the SSM Regulation I would like to highlight relates to the principle of separation of the monetary and supervisory function', 'The important role given to the Supervisory Board vis-à-vis the Governing Council, already referred to, is one of the various safeguards ensuring a clear separation between the monetary and supervisory function of the ECB', 'Additionally, deliberations of the Governing Council on supervisory matters will be strictly separated, including separated agendas and meetings', 'The ECB fully subscribes to the need for a clear separation between its monetary and supervisory function and the provisions to this end mentioned in the proposed legislation', 'But let me stress that separation does not mean isolation', 'The conferral of supervisory tasks to a central bank is in line with the responsibilities of many other central banks that combine these two functions', 'In fact, the crisis has only strengthened the trend of central banks acquiring supervisory responsibilities and there are many good reasons for conferring supervisory powers to the central bank', 'A first argument is that a stable financial system is a necessity for the smooth conduct of monetary policy and as such a major concern of any central bank', 'Second, there are information synergies between the oversight of payment systems and the supervision of banks', 'The ECB is not only responsible for the oversight of all large-value payment systems operating in the euro area, but also the owner of the TARGET2 system, the largest of such systems', 'Third, central banks have a lot of expertise on the financial sector', 'The constant monitoring of the different market segments in order to assess the transmission of monetary policy contributes to their understanding of the financial sector and to act quickly in situations of financial stress', 'Fourth, central banks will be able to achieve a better management of its counterparties´ creditworthiness in monetary policy operations', 'Fifth, central banks are particularly prepared to manage macroprudential policies as they have a deep knowledge of the macroeconomic and financial cycles and monetary policy shares the same concerns with macroprudential policy, namely the stabilisation of the cycle to ensure price stability in the medium and long term', 'This provides the justification for the fact that in Europe and around the world Central Banks are given macroprudential authority even when they not have micro supervisory powers', 'In fact, the usual arguments to separate monetary policy from supervision do not apply to macroprudential policy', 'In particular, the potential conflicts, the sensitivity and reputation risks resulting from decisions about individual institutions do not arise in what regards macroprudential policies', 'It is then to be expected that the Governing Council of the ECB will show more interest in those policies', 'On the other hand, there are also advantages in not subsuming the macroprudential perspective in the micro supervisory body as the systemic risk is not the natural standpoint of observation of such body', 'Macroprudential concerns should be functionally separate in any organization that has both functions as it happens currently with various central banks in Europe', 'Thus, although the conduct of supervision will be a new task for the ECB, as the euro area’s central bank, we have built up extensive expertise in macroeconomic and financial stability issues', 'While safeguarding any potential conflicts of interest between the monetary and supervisory function, the benefits of combining these two tasks in one institution are evident and should be reaped', 'Of course the concentration of more powers at the ECB, implies a higher level of accountability', 'The Council proposal also addresses the issue by creating a Review Panel of the SSM decisions from a legal point of view and, in particular, by defining the accountability of the SSM before the European Parliament', 'Main immediate tasks of the SSM One of the main priorities for the ECB during 2013 is ensuring the operationalization of the SSM, so that it can assume its responsibilities effectively and efficiently', 'Building a strong centre  Creating a strong centre in a decentralised system such as the SSM, will be crucial to ensure the ECB’s reputation is safeguarded', 'The monetary policy function of the central bank requires that it maintains a high level of credibility', 'This is essential to keep anchored inflation expectations', 'When the central bank is responsible for both price stability and banking supervision, weaknesses in supervision could damage the reputation of the central bank as a competent monetary authority', 'Furthermore, it could be argued that the central bank faces higher reputational risks in conducting its supervisory function than its monetary policy function', 'This is simply due to the very different nature of the tasks', 'News about a failing bank can be automatically wrongly perceived as a result of deficient supervision cancelling out reputation built over a stream of years with no news about problem banks', 'In addition, the ECB will need to build up its reputation in its supervisory function', 'While the full independence and legal means are at the core of the system in the SSM construction, the close proximity with the supervised entities and expertise of national supervisory authorities are essential to ensure that no aspect is overlooked', 'As I mentioned before the system will be very much decentralised', 'Even in the case of banks directly supervised from the centre, the experts from national authorities will be involved in on-site inspections and these and other operations should be conducted in the context of joint supervisory teams headed by ECB´s experts', 'The success of the SSM will hinge on the knowledge and skills of its human capital', 'Therefore the recruitment of skilled and experienced staff, including banking supervisors, will be a priority', 'This will be, to a large extent, built on the system resources, in line with the experience in cooperation within the Eurosystem', 'Review of banks’ balance-sheets  An immediate task of the SSM will be a comprehensive review of the banks brought under its responsibility, namely the banks that will come under the direct supervision of the ECB', 'This is requested in the Council Regulation in view of possible legacy issues, which could put the SSM reputation at stake further down the road', 'Ahead of assuming the responsibility for the supervision of banks, the ECB in cooperation with national supervisory authorities will need to carry out a comprehensive assessment of their balance-sheets', 'This exercise will include elements of an asset quality review which is instrumental in identifying potential legacy problems', 'The treatment of legacy assets in the overall Banking Union project is an important issue, notably in connection with the European direct recapitalisation of banks', 'It has to be ensured that in the setting up of a European Resolution Mechanism, the losses of legacy assets, in accordance with good resolution principles, will be borne first by the banks’ shareholders and/or partly by the countries where they are domiciled, so that the use of any European funds do not raise issues of moral hazard and/or unjustified excessive mutualisation of losses coming from the past', 'As it happens when a private investor takes a stake in the capital of a troubled bank, appropriate due diligence is conducted and will impact the determination of the price of entry thus diluting previous shareholders', 'Solutions will need to be worked out whenever legacy assets threaten to overwhelm the fiscal capacity of Member States', 'In such cases, mechanisms would need to be found so as to provide support at the European level ensuring that the scheme of incentives remains aligned', 'Member States will need to keep a fair share of their responsibilities so that resolution objectives are fully and timely complied with', 'The ECB is prepared to conduct the necessary balance-sheet reviews and related assessments in cooperation with other national and EU authorities and possibly third parties', 'This is particularly the case for forward-looking analysis of banks’ solvency in the form of stress tests for individual banks, envisaged in the legislative proposal establishing the SSM', 'The ECB, similarly to other national central banks, has over the years strengthened its analytical capacity to support its financial stability function, notably the need to carry out systemic risk assessments in real time to support policy discussions', '[6] Such analytical capability supporting financial stability assessment work has furthermore been essential to support country-specific analysis to support discussions on the financial sector of countries under financial assistance and in support to the EBA in conducting EU-wide macro stress tests', 'The systemic risk concerns of macroprudential policies has led to the development of a suite of tools and models with a view to assess and quantify the impact of systemic risks on the banking sector and ultimately on the real economy', 'The existing macro stress testing framework is particularly suited to assist the reviews of banks’ balance sheets and provide comparable forward looking assessments of banks’ solvency on an individual basis', 'More broadly, these comprehensive reviews will provide transparency into the composition and credit quality of banks’ loan portfolios, in the spirit of asset quality reviews', 'Such financial due diligence would furthermore inform about provisioning and loss mitigation policies and broadly validate banks’ reporting', 'This exercise should contribute to increase comparability across banks – in line with EBA efforts on harmonisation of definitions and practices supervisory processes', 'Harmonising supervisory procedures and risk assessments  At a larger scale, the ECB needs to conduct fundamental work – in cooperation with the EBA – to develop a manual of supervisory practices, defining processes and procedures for conducting supervision in the EU', 'This should ensure a harmonised approach to the way supervision is conducted and increase comparability across supervisory assessments – e', 'g', 'regarding provisioning and risk mitigation policies - under the new EU supervisory framework', 'Related work that is underway and coordinated by the EBA, notably on forbearance risk and impaired asset classification will represent in this connection valuable contributions to the convergence of procedures to best practices', 'Provisioning and loss mitigation policies may differ quite substantially across countries at present', 'The need for harmonisation is apparent as these represent key elements affecting assessments of banks’ capacity to withstand credit losses', 'Furthermore, work done within EBA on risk assessment inputs to the supervisory review process – a topic that I will return to in a second – also represent important steps in this harmonisation process', 'The establishment of the SSM also requires the harmonisation of supervisory risk assessment frameworks', 'In fact, amid a vast range of indicators of bank-specific vulnerabilities and partial analysis, there is no harmonised risk assessment methodology across Europe that could support a common framework for supervisory assessments in the EU', 'This would entail the creation of some sort of European Supervisory Rating System in the spirit of the Uniform Financial Rating System introduced by US regulators in 1979', 'Special emphasis is needed on definitions and forward-looking dimensions that could signal bank distress further down the road', 'Quantitative indicators and qualitative judgements about governance and risk management will be included in the risk profile of banks and their overall classification', 'Here as well, the ECB stands out as well equipped to support this SSM task, in cooperation with EU and national authorities', 'Over recent years, efforts have been made to strengthen the risk surveillance function to assist ECB responsibilities in the field of financial stability', 'This has to a large extent published in official financial stability publications, most prominently, the ECB Financial Stability Review', 'I would highlight, in particular, the importance of work conducted in the area of early warning models', 'Beyond investments in developing analytical tools and models that can provide early warnings of the build-up of financial imbalances at the aggregated level, efforts have also gone in the direction of the analysis of individual banks', 'Methodologies combining bank-specific indicators, in the spirit of the CAMELS indicators, with country-specific indicators for the banking sector and country-specific macro-financial indicators are being used and will be further explored to predict distress in banks', '[7] In this respect, model-based frameworks of contagion accounting for vulnerabilities arising from interdependencies across banks are also being developed', 'There is a long way to go on the analytical front but these are already important first steps that should cater for a solid establishment of the new framework for supervision in Europe', 'These efforts are essential in the construction of the Banking Union', 'Conclusion Let me conclude', 'The agreement reached on the SSM by the Council shows the resolve to strengthen the EMU by strengthening the institutional financial framework', 'The SSM is a key component, but it is only one component of the Banking Union', 'In particular, a European framework for resolution of banks – with a Single Resolution Mechanism centerd on a Single Resolution Authority needs to follow', 'We fully support the intention announced by the Commission to present a legislative proposal for a single resolution mechanism, having at the center a resolution authority that should be approved before the SSM becomes fully operational', 'The prospect of the creation of Banking Supervision at the European level, complemented by future European banking resolution, is the more far reaching change introduced since the inception of the euro', 'It reveals the willingness of Member States to continue to deepen European integration and create at the same time a better framework for the effective functioning of the euro area', 'Few could have foreseen such momentous developments', 'A man of vision and a great European, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, who preceded me as the member of the ECB´s Board responsible for financial stability wrote in 1999 a few weeks after the inception of the euro: [8] “ I am convinced, however, that in the future the needs will change and the multilateral mode  [9]  will have to deepen substantially', 'Over time such a mode will have to be structured to the point of providing the banking industry with a true and effective collective euro area supervisor', 'It will have to be enhanced to the full extent required for banking supervision in the euro area to be as prompt and effective as it is within a single nation”', 'At the time this might have sounded as premature to many but they should have listened to another man of great vision, Jean Monnet, who wrote in his Memoires: “There  are no premature ideas, there are only opportune moments that it is necessary to wait for …', 'Everything is possible in exceptional moments provided we would be ready', '“   I am confident we will be ready', 'Thank you for your attention', '[1]See, e', 'g', 'Gros, D (2012), ‘An incomplete

      " list(['Ladies and gentlemen,  Thank you very much for the invitation to speak at the 2006 EFMA Cards and Payments Conference', 'John Maynard Keynes described three purposes of money', 'It should act as: a means of transaction; a means of accounting; and a store of value', 'For several thousand years, coins were needed for all three purposes', 'Then, around 1,200 years ago the Chinese introduced banknotes', 'Now we have cards and they can fulfil all three purposes to a certain degree', 'Should we stop printing banknotes and minting coins', 'No, cash will remain an important means of payment even in the long term', 'You probably believe that central bankers have a clear preference for cash given that seigniorage is an important source of income for central banks', 'As central bankers, we are not maximising profit; rather, we are interested in the smooth functioning of payment systems and in their efficiency', 'For us, maintaining price stability – our main task – implies building confidence that the purchasing power of the currency will not erode over time', 'Part of the stock of our euro currency is issued by the Eurosystem itself: banknotes, coins and credit positions of the financial system with the Eurosystem', 'The bigger part of the currency stock is issued by several thousands of credit institutions in the form of sight deposits held by non-financial economic agents', 'Despite these different issuers, one euro claim on, for example, the Société Générale has to be interchangeable at any time with another euro claim on, say, Fortis Bank', 'That is the cornerstone of our monetary order', 'This interchangeability is effectuated millions of times a day through the payment processing chain', 'Hence, the smooth functioning of the payment processing chain is crucial in underpinning the confidence in the currency, just as is keeping inflation low', 'This was well understood by the drafters of the Treaty on European Union and the Statute of the ECB, where the promotion of the smooth operation of payment systems is listed as one of four basic tasks', 'Your task is running a successful business and you have been successful so far', 'You will be even more successful if you create a SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) for cards in a reasonable time frame and if you succeed in that the use of cash should be less prevalent than it is now', 'Some European countries are late in moving towards modern means of payment that are reliable and convenient and offer cost savings', 'Will SEPA itself change this lagging behind in the use of new technologies', 'Yes, to a certain degree, because more competition should create more ideas on how cultures could be convinced to change', 'Slide 2   I have organised my remarks as follows: Why can cards play a relevant role in replacing cash', 'What is the ECB’s view on cards', 'How do we see the different models defined by the banks for SEPA', 'Some remarks on interchange fees', 'The ECB’s role in the SEPA project', 'I will end my presentation today by highlighting the opportunities that SEPA and innovation can bring to the retail payment market', 'Slide 3   The intention of banks to replace cash by cashless instruments is not new', 'Already for some time, banks have been trying to reduce the use of cash, but so far with only limited success', 'In my view, the most realistic endgame does not need to be the replacement of all cash transactions by cashless transactions', 'What I perceive as important is that the number of cash transactions remains stable despite the growth of the economy', 'This would be a clear indication that other payment instruments have become more accepted', 'Cards, in this respect, have played and will continue to play an important role', 'Taking the example of France, you can see the high potential that cards have, being already the preferred instrument for transactions between 25 and 260 euro', 'I am sure that this graph mirrors the situation in other European countries and shows in which range of transactions the cards industry can progress further', 'Slide 4   This Monday the World Payments Report 2006 prepared by Capgemini, ABN AMRO and EFMA was presented at this conference', 'The figures provided in the report show the increase in terms of volume of non-cash payment transactions in Europe', 'The increase may differ from one country to another, but it shows, in any case, that cashless instruments are gaining in acceptance and usage', 'It is important to note here that the report also shows that cards recorded the highest growth among the three core SEPA instruments, being in 2004 the most popular instrument in the selected European countries', 'Slide 5   In this context, I would now like to refer to the experience in Norway in replacing cash by cashless instruments', 'In the 2005 Annual Report on Payments Systems of the Norwegian central bank (Norges Bank), I noticed some interesting data on the value of banknotes and coins in circulation as a share of household consumption and as a share of mainland GDP in the period 1996-2005', 'In this period, the share of cash decreased by approximately two percentage points', 'Slide 6   At the same time, the Norges Bank report shows that the number of payment terminals doubled during the same period', 'The use of cash is certainly linked to other aspects than the efficiency of the retail instruments in place in a given country', 'However, we cannot exclude that both trends are closely interrelated', 'It may be that efficient, widely used payment instruments more easily attract cash payments', 'Slide 7    Unlike what has happened in Norway, the use of cash is still increasing in the European Union', 'The use of cash is also covered in the World Payments Report 2006', 'On the question “Is cash declining in Europe', '”, the report concludes that there are no signs of a fall in the use of cash, which remains the preferred means of payment of European citizens', 'The report, however, shows that card transaction growth has outpaced growth in ATM cash withdrawals', 'Slide 8   Apart from the efficiency of the retail payment instruments in place, often the usage of cash or cards is also strongly dependent on the way customers are used to making payments in their respective country', 'For example, as shown in this graph, in Spain customers prefer to pay in cash, even taking into account the high penetration of terminals in shops', 'This brings me to the following question: Would preferences of customers change if the prices of payment instruments would be cost-based', 'Slide 9   Let us go back to the experience in Norway', 'In 1981, banks in Norway started to charge for the use of cheques', 'However, at this stage there was no universal payment card system in place in Norway, but the number of ATMs was increasing', 'As a consequence, the use of cash increased considerably', 'In 1992, when a common card system was put in place, and the charging for ATM withdrawals increased, the number of card transactions started to increase (from 100 million transactions in 1992 to 700 hundred million transactions in 2005)', 'Moreover, as was shown on slide 4, the number of cash transactions started to drop', 'I believe that the experience in Norway is a good indication that cards can become a good replacement for cash as long as they become a more convenient payment instrument than cash', 'Hence, the banking industry faces the challenge of delivering a highly efficient cards market in SEPA', 'But this is not the only challenge that the banking sector is facing', 'I also believe that the banking sector needs to address the inefficiencies of cash', 'Cash is a crucial means of payment', 'Moreover, there are no indications that the importance of cash will diminish in the near future', 'In this respect, I expect the banking sector to invest in enhancing the processing of cash', 'There are already some good examples of the banking industry taking measures in this field', 'The decision of ABN AMRO and Rabobank to concentrate cash processing activities is one example', 'Both of these banks in the Netherlands decided to cooperate in this field because the Dutch central bank will largely phase out its cash processing tasks from 1 January 2008', 'The daily counting and recirculation of euro notes and coins will then be transferred to a new company so that the quality standards set by the Eurosystem can be met in a more efficient manner', 'Slide 10   As stated in the Eurosystem’s Fourth Progress Report on SEPA, any cardholder should be able to use his or her card in any ATM or POS, at a reasonable cost, without differentiation based on the country of issuance well in advance of 2010', 'The cardholder is only the end-point', 'Consequently, all stakeholders involved in the value chain, such as merchants, issuers, acquirers and card schemes, are concerned', 'Often, the message of the ECB on cards has been misunderstood and has been seen as an obligation for the merchants to accept all cards despite the costs which this would entail', 'Let me clarify that this is most certainly not our objective', 'Merchants should only accept a card if this is in their own interest, but technical conditions allowing acceptance should be in place', 'It is in the interest of the banking industry to provide its customers with interesting business proposals and a secure and efficient setting to conduct card transactions within SEPA and to expand acceptance', 'Slide 11   The implementation of a SEPA for cards will be one of the most lengthy stages in the process of SEPA migration', 'Unlike what has been done for credit transfers and direct debits, the European Payments Council (EPC), instead of designing a new scheme, decided to define a very general framework', 'This framework was approved by the EPC Plenary Meeting in September 2005', 'While I have nothing against such an approach, as a consequence of leaving many options open, the implementation has become a real challenge and therefore needs to remain high on the EPC’s agenda', 'An important aspect is standardisation', 'In this respect, the EPC’s recent plan to focus on the identification of appropriate technical standards for cards is very much welcomed', 'I encourage the EPC to set up a clear time frame for this work, which is compatible with the timetable of the SEPA project, and to guarantee that the proposed standardisation will be open and future-minded', 'I am also concerned that SEPA could, paradoxically, worsen the current situation for cardholders and merchants', 'Let me explain', 'The objective of SEPA is to overcome the fragmentation currently in the euro area', 'The idea is that the current domestic markets will be replaced by a new domestic market at the euro area level', 'In the cards business, domestic transactions are conducted through national card schemes', 'National card schemes are, in general, efficient for both cardholders and merchants', 'SEPA should not mean that cardholders and merchants are negatively affected by this migration process', 'I will now describe how this risk could materialise', 'Slide 12   The EPC defined three different models for a card scheme to become compliant, as described in the SEPA Cards Framework (SCF):     to select one (or more) of the international card schemes to replace the current national scheme(s) once the international card scheme(s) has/have become SCF-compliant;   evolution through alliances with other card schemes or through an expansion to the entire euro area; and   co-branding with an international scheme – provided that both the national and international schemes have become SCF-compliant', 'Slide 13   How would these different models look', 'There are two main stakeholders apart from banks: national and international schemes', 'To deliver their services throughout SEPA, national card schemes have three main choices: (i)\\xa0entering into alliances, (ii) merging with existing schemes or (iii)\\xa0extending their own operations to other countries', 'In parallel, international card schemes are also developing SEPA service offers to compete also in the same market', 'I believe that no option should be excluded', 'Hence, a combination of the different models would create a scenario which would foster competition within SEPA', 'Slide 14   I would like to insist that the ECB is neutral on the models to be adopted by the banking industry to achieve a SEPA for cards as long as the following principles are being respected: SEPA is about choice', 'Choice for customers, retailers, corporates and banks', 'There will be a lack of choice if SEPA ends up with only two schemes which are SEPA-compliant', 'In this respect, I will be very clear', 'Without questioning the importance of both international card schemes (VISA and MasterCard) in the euro area, in particular in terms of cross-border volume and value, the ECB would see as necessary the creation of at least another European scheme, so that the expertise and efficiency of national schemes is not wasted', 'The different models explained on the previous slide give the opportunity to national card schemes to evolve', 'I expect that both international and national card schemes will play a role within a SEPA for cards', 'So, from this perspective, I would like to support initiatives which create more choice for users, regardless of the origin of the initiative', 'Please allow me to refer here to one recent example', 'You are, I am sure, all aware that the banking industry in Belgium has decided to dismantle the current national card scheme and give the card business to MasterCard', 'I expect that this is not the endgame and that Belgian users will also benefit from competition in the entire euro area', 'To be explicit, SEPA should not lead to a quasi-monopolistic situation in the cards market', 'Instead, competition should be fostered by the removal of any technical, legal or commercial barriers', 'The EPC has been working on identifying these aspects, and the Sector Inquiry of the European Commission addressed several of them, such as the vertical integration of card schemes, governance arrangements restricting entry and diverging technical standards', 'The ECB will support technical and/or business initiatives that contribute to competition in the cards market', 'I already referred to the importance of national card schemes becoming part of the SEPA project', 'They have the expertise on how to conduct business in their countries, but what is even more important is that the level of satisfaction of both merchants and cardholders is in general very high', 'National schemes have an obligation too', 'In the end, it cannot be the case that by default, current national schemes are chosen', 'The merchant should have the choice to enable competition between international and national schemes too', 'Apart from international card schemes offering SEPA solutions, up to now the only SEPA initiative by national card schemes of which I am aware is the constitution of the Euro Alliance of Payment Systems', 'Following a declaration of intent in May this year, card schemes of Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Portugal and Italy became founding members of this initiative which has recently been formalised', 'This is, in my view, an important step by national card schemes towards offering their services within SEPA, and I invite all parties to consider to what extent they can contribute to this or possibly other initiatives', 'Slide 15   Another important aspect is co-branding', 'I understand that in a first stage co-branding will be the only vehicle some card schemes will have to reach the whole euro area', 'Co-branding should not be seen, however, as the final solution within SEPA', 'The final aim of card schemes is to be able to attract business from the whole SEPA', 'Co-branding at this final stage should be limited mainly, or even better, only, to transactions outside SEPA, in the sense that acceptance of the remaining card schemes will have reached its development potential in the euro area market, in the same way that national schemes cover national markets today', 'You may wonder why I make such a strong statement concerning co-branding in the long run', 'I perceive co-branding to be a way of freezing the current fragmentation in the cards market, a situation that would totally contradict the final aim of SEPA', 'In this respect, I expect the banking industry to develop pan-European schemes with a reach across the whole SEPA', 'As this is currently the case in most SEPA countries for national transactions, I believe that in the new context, in which a new SEPA domestic market will emerge, the banking industries should be able to deliver what they have already proved themselves able to deliver within the national borders', 'Another very relevant aspect is the separation of scheme and processing', 'The separation of card scheme governance and processing is an issue that has also been understood by the EPC and is therefore addressed in the SEPA Cards Framework', 'I understand that this is a crucial issue to be addressed in order to foster competition in the cards business', 'I would like to conclude my comments on this slide by mentioning the experience we have had with TARGET because of its similarities to the possible evolution of the cards market', 'TARGET was the system that interlinked the different real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems in Europe', 'After approximately ten years of operation, TARGET will be replaced by TARGET2', 'The objective of TARGET2 is to offer the same services in the whole euro area without any differentiation according to the country where the RTGS is located', 'By interlinking systems in a first stage, we will achieve further consolidation with TARGET2', 'Why should this not be one of the alternative ways in which the cards industry could evolve in Europe', 'Slide 16   A crucial topic in the discussion is of course interchange fees, which are currently surrounded by much uncertainty', 'The Sector Inquiry of the European Commission provided some very comprehensive and interesting information on the issue', 'It is clear that the current levels of interchange fees do not seem sustainable', 'The data of the Commission show that even in the absence of interchange fees, card issuing would still be a profitable activity', 'I am aware that the data used have been contested, but the overall pattern seems to be reliable', 'I expect that the Commission will clarify the interchange fee issue as soon as possible', 'In the meantime, banks should not take strategic decisions about their future based on the current level of interchange fees', 'Transparency is also an absolute need; the Sector Inquiry referred to the blending practices which hinder competition', 'The effects of regulatory decisions should be carefully evaluated', 'Cardholders in particular should not be adversely affected by regulation', 'What do I mean by that', 'Let us imagine a scenario in which decisions taken by regulators would imply that cardholders are subject to higher fees than at present', 'This would certainly be negatively seen by the public and would have adverse effects on the perception they have of SEPA', 'On top of that, this would make the business case for cards to replace cash less attractive', 'Slide 17   Please allow me now to say something on the role of the ECB in this process', 'The EPC was set up by the banking industry in order to avoid further regulations on payment issues', 'This shows the banking industry’s commitment to self-regulation', 'The European Commission and the ECB have an important role in keeping up the momentum in the banking-led process and in ensuring that the interests of all stakeholders are incorporated', 'The ECB and the national central banks also monitor the implementation of SEPA', 'I am pleased to hear that in most countries committees have been set up to monitor this implementation', 'National central banks are very active in those committees and should continue to be until migration has been completed', 'In order to learn about the trends in the decisions of the different banking communities concerning a SEPA for cards, the Eurosystem, together with national banking associations, has conducted a survey with national and international card schemes', 'Based on this survey, a report is going to be discussed with the ECB Governing Council', 'This shows the interest that the Governing Council has in the progress that the banking industry is making on cards', 'Slide 18   Before I finish my presentation, I will provide you with some thoughts on the future of the retail payment market in Europe and the challenges that lie ahead of us', 'I expect that SEPA will be an important contribution to the financial integration of Europe', 'By creating a competitive environment and by exploiting economies of scale, the goals of the Lisbon agenda of promoting productivity, growth and employment within Europe will be supported', 'However, this will only happen if SEPA is seen as not just being a conversion project that allows banks to maintain their current national models and processes by just implementing converters on top of them', 'SEPA is not just about euro area standardisation, it is also about the future of the retail payment market in Europe', 'Banks can profit from SEPA if they adapt forward-looking innovative strategies', 'Moreover, progress in information and communication technology can be used to offer customers convenient, secure and efficient services that make their life easier and allow them to free up resources which they can use elsewhere', 'Customers may save costs, reduce risk and save liquidity', 'I am convinced that the retail payment market in Europe offers more business opportunities than just payments', 'Even if payments themselves are processed efficiently between banks, the payer and the payee may have substantial work with payment initiation and reconciliation', 'Let me give you some examples of current restrictions and difficulties and how they can be overcome', 'For payers, the common channels for payment initiation are currently rather limited', 'They either need to be in front of a computer with internet access, at an ATM or in a branch of their bank to initiate a payment', 'In future, payments could be widely enabled through additional channels, e', 'g', 'mobile telephones, allowing customers to make payments from wherever they are – provided there is a connection to the mobile network of course', 'Corporations could make substantial savings from a paper-free bill presentation and e-reconciliation process', 'To reap these benefits, customers would have to be prepared to pay for the service', 'This would be a win-win situation for service providers and customers', 'Slide 19   To conclude, I encourage the banking industry to continue its work on making cashless payment instruments more efficient', 'This is the only way that those instruments can attract cash payments', 'As different analyses have shown, the last one presented by Capgemini at this conference, there is no evidence that cash payments will be completely replaced even in the long term', 'In this sense, I expect the banking industry is also working on making cash payments more efficient', 'The SEPA Cards Framework developed by the EPC provides a good basis for creating a SEPA for cards', 'The Eurosystem has a neutral view in relation to the models adopted as long as competition in the cards market is ensured', 'SEPA is not only a matter of adapting existing instruments to the new environment', 'Banks should make use of SEPA to modernise current service offers and to benefit from the economies of scale that SEPA entails', 'SEPA provides a unique opportunity that should not be missed', 'Let me therefore come back to John Maynard Keynes whose three purposes of money opened my speech', 'Keynes said: “The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping the old ones, which ramify, for those brought up as most of us have been, into every corner of our minds', '” I encourage you to continue modernising the payments landscape: be creative in developing new products, efficient processes and attractive services and help your customers to overcome their reluctance, to change their payment habits and to embrace new payment methods', 'SEE ALSO  Find out more about related content   Presentation  Slides from the presentation, pdf 264 kB'])\n",
      " list(['The recent financial crisis, and the euro area sovereign debt crisis that followed, were characterised by periods of increased heterogeneity, market fragmentation and sudden turns in economic activity', 'This often made it difficult for economic policymakers to understand and assess in real time the underlying forces driving economic behaviour', 'Both traditional statistical datasets and our models proved at times inadequate to support the decision-making process, reflecting long time lags, linear assumptions and the absence of more granular information', 'These events increasingly boosted the efforts in policy circles to obtain timelier and richer data for policy analysis, in short big data', '[1] This push towards more granular information was not a revolution, however', 'It can be argued that big data, under different guises, have been used as an input into policymaking since Adolphe Quételet’s Mémoire in 1848', 'Since then, big data has been central to business cycle analysis, from the early work of Clément Juglar to the contributions of both Wesley Mitchell and the Cowles Commission, right up until today', 'According to central bank mythology, former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan would sit in his bathtub perusing sheets of statistics', 'And indeed, economic historians have analysed how the power of governments has been shaped by statistics – and vice versa', '[2]  The most recent push towards more granular data was thus an evolution rather than a revolution, triggered in part by the emergence of new opportunities – themselves a reflection of rapid technological progress – and the experience gained over several years of crisis management', 'This evolution is already bearing fruit', 'Policymakers today have access to a large number of micro datasets, often very different in nature and scope', 'Some are the result of new financial regulations', 'Others are by-products of increased use of technology', 'What they have in common, however, is that, if used appropriately and responsibly, they can help policymakers to extract more timely and diverse economic signals, and thus are a meaningful complement to existing official data', 'In my remarks this morning, I will take stock of the progress made at the ECB, and in the central banking community more generally, on the use of more granular data in the conduct of monetary policy', '[3] I will show that micro data collected by central banks themselves, in particular data on transactions between banks, have already proven to be an additional valuable guide for policymakers in devising policy responses', 'And I will show that data generated through the greater use of technology in our daily lives have an enormous potential to help policymakers overcome prevailing constraints on timely data availability, understand better the consequences of their policies and calibrate them accordingly, while also creating challenges', 'Central banks as big data collectors Let me start with the role of central banks as producers of big data', 'Central banks do not have to be at the forefront of data collection, and we should not seek to displace private sector efforts', 'That said, there are areas in which central banks have started, or are about to start, collecting large amounts of data to help them monitor developments in financial markets and allow them to extract richer information about the transmission of monetary policy, which in turn helps us calibrate our policies', 'As a showcase for these efforts, I would like to discuss two such initiatives, namely the money market statistical reporting (MMSR) data, which the ECB, in collaboration with the wider Eurosystem, has been collecting since July 2016, and the so-called AnaCredit project, short for “analytical credit datasets”, which will produce its first results over the course of next year', '[4]  MMSR data contain confidential daily information on the individual euro-denominated loans in the euro money market from the 52 largest euro area banks, which collectively account for approximately 80-85% of the total balance sheet of euro area banks', 'At present, this means collecting information on 10,000 daily transactions in the unsecured money market, with a daily volume of around €100 billion', 'We also collect data on around 30,000 daily transactions on secured loans, worth around €500 billion', 'Earlier this week, the project took an important step forward with the publication of the first set of euro area money market statistics, covering each of the Eurosystem’s reserve maintenance periods in 2017', '[5] The published data cover the unsecured market', 'The aim is to publish data on the secured market in 2018 once we are satisfied that the data are of sufficiently high quality', 'The sheer volume of data, combined with the high frequency with which it is collected, means that the standard verification process involving human beings is not feasible', 'Carrying out checks by algorithm, using machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence is one way of ensuring that data remain of high quality', 'The Eurosystem has a steep learning curve in front of itself', 'These efforts will no doubt pay off', 'Indeed, MMSR data have proven highly useful to policymakers in their short period of existence', 'Let me give you an example', 'The data help us assess the impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programme (APP) on market functioning, as I explained in more detail in a speech I gave last week in Brussels', '[6]  MMSR data show that since the ECB launched the APP there has been a marked shift away from trades backed by general collateral, which are traditionally used to manage cash', 'Instead, there has been a growing share of repos off the general collateral curve, termed specials', 'Take for example the German Bund market', 'Traditionally, only around 5% of bonds in the German repo market traded as special, but in the second half of last year, that share rose to 50%', 'Being aware of the distribution of trades and the premium placed on special bonds enables us to assess the impact of the APP on market functioning', 'To ease potential frictions, we decided last December to allow cash to be used as collateral in our securities lending programme, and to permit APP purchases below the deposit facility rate', 'As a result of these decisions, the “specialness” premium on long-term German bonds has declined, and the share of bonds that trade special is now around 30%', 'A further notable area of use for MMSR data has emerged from growing concerns about the reliability and robustness of current risk-free benchmark rates for the euro area', '[7] Banks have become increasingly reluctant to participate in benchmark panels, owing to concerns about potential litigation, compliance risks and costs', 'The resulting uncertainty in the integrity of reference rates represents a potentially serious source of vulnerability and systemic risk', 'Against this backdrop, the ECB recently announced that it intends to provide a new overnight unsecured interest rate, using MMSR transaction data', 'The new rate is intended to complement existing benchmark rates produced by the private sector and serve as a backstop reference rate, with the aim to start publishing by 2020', '[8] This move is motivated by our desire to mitigate the potential adverse impact on the monetary transmission mechanism and on financial stability from the lack of reliable benchmarks', 'The market facilitating role played by the ECB in this field is consistent with the tasks conferred upon it by its Statute', 'The process will involve broad consultation with market participants, end-users and other public authorities', 'A first public consultation will be launched before the end of 2017', 'The use of MMSR data implies that the new overnight interest rate will differ from the current EONIA benchmark in a number of ways', '[9] Accordingly, any decision pertaining to this new benchmark rate does not bear direct consequences for the choice of our operational target', 'Let me now say a brief word about the second initiative I mentioned earlier, namely the AnaCredit project, which will push the frontier of big data use at the ECB further out', '[10]  AnaCredit will deliver loan-by-loan information, mostly on a monthly basis, on credit to companies and other legal entities extended by euro area banks', 'Early estimates point to around 70 million exposures reported every month, representing loans granted by about 4,500 credit institutions to more than 15 million counterparties', '[11] In view of these large expected data volumes, a state-of-the-art IT infrastructure is currently under development, which will also take into account the need to ensure the adequate protection of confidentiality', 'AnaCredit data collection has been designed to produce a complete picture of the credit exposure of the reporting population', 'The information collected comprises almost 100 different “attributes” covering various aspects of the credit exposure, such as the outstanding amount, maturity, interest rate, collateral or guarantee, information on the counterparty, and many other things', 'Access to highly granular loan-level information will be a major step forward in helping policymakers to analyse and monitor credit developments and to assess the impact of their decisions on bank lending', 'As you know, bank lending plays a key role in the euro area, where the share of loans in the total external financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is considerably higher than in the Anglo-Saxon world, where market financing plays a more important role', 'Granular AnaCredit data will help us look beyond aggregates and extract the underlying developments', 'Granular loan-by-loan data will allow us to know the characteristics of specific groups of counterparties involved in each transaction, without of course revealing their identities', 'This means that we will be able to assess the driving forces behind aggregate developments and distinguish genuine and healthy growth from potential exuberance', 'This is crucial for policymakers', 'And, finally, although no data will be collected specifically for supervisory purposes in the initial stages of the project, the information will also be very useful in many areas of banking supervision', 'I am thinking in particular of the information on the link between lenders and the unique identification of counterparties across the entire lender population', 'The use of big data in policy analysis Let me now turn to the broader issue of the use by central banks of technology-driven data', 'An early and prominent example of online data being used for policy analysis is the “Billion Prices Project”, which was launched by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2008', '[12] Today, the project publishes daily online price indices for more than 20 countries, based on a technology called “web scraping”, where price information is collected automatically by machine from hundreds of retailers that also have physical outlets', 'By 2015, about 15 million prices were being collected every day from 900 retailers', 'The advantages for policymakers are plain to see', 'Online inflation data, if of high quality, are much timelier than current price statistics and may cover a much larger number of products', 'Eurostat currently collects, via the national statistical institutes, roughly three million prices for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices every month in the 28 EU Member States and it publishes the index 17 days after the end of each month', 'Online price data can therefore be used to improve short-term forecasts and to check the robustness and reliability of current price indices', 'Mixed-frequency models, for example, could be used to enhance existing forecast models that are based on monthly data', 'Sveriges Riksbank has already tested the use of online price data', 'The results indicate that the data add value when it comes to forecasting short-term developments in consumer prices for fruit and vegetables', '[13] Preliminary explorative analysis at the ECB confirms the predictive power of online price data, provided they are sufficiently granular', 'This suggests that online prices may complement existing price data', 'Daily online data can also add significant value to policymaking in periods of high uncertainty', 'As research has shown, would the full Billion Prices Project data have been available in 2008, the turning point in US inflation following the demise of Lehman Brothers could have been identified months before it showed up in the official US consumer price Index', '[14]  Online prices are, however, only one source of potential interest for policymakers', 'Large-scale barcode scanner data, for example, are an alternative avenue that researchers at the ECB have explored in the past to investigate factors that determine prices and the degree of price dispersion, much in the tradition of our long-standing efforts under the umbrella of the Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network', '[15] The data, which consist of 3', '5 million observations on the price and quantity of individual products sold, have confirmed that competition at producer and retail level is a key factor affecting micro price-setting', 'Insights gained from the use of online and scanner data have also encouraged the ECB to make micro-price research a strategic research priority between 2018 and 2020', 'The first step is to pick up where the Inflation Persistence Network left off, by resuming the collection of micro data underlying the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index and complementing them, where possible, with scanner and online price data', '[16] Collaboration within the Eurosystem will once again be vital for the success of this ambitious project', 'The ECB, with the help of the national central banks, also draws on big data to help improve business cycle analysis', 'Google search data, for example, have been suggested as a potentially valuable source of data for policymakers', 'Back in 2012, Hal Varian and co-author showed that Google searches can help predict economic activity', '[17]  Building on this idea, ESCB staff have explored the possibility of nowcasting unemployment using volumes reported by Google Trends for a large number of search queries broadly related to unemployment', 'They find that many of the search terms indeed correlate with unemployment and may reduce forecasting errors by up to 80% by comparison with naive benchmark models', '[18] Job search and related Google search quotes have also been found to be strong predictors of variations in subjective wellbeing', '[19] Similar initiatives are underway for more leading indicators', 'Related to this, electronic payment data from credit cards and cash withdrawals from ATMs have been shown to help forecast private consumption as well as GDP growth, provided that they are made available in a timely manner', '[20] These data are also less prone to revision than traditional national accounts data', 'Our internal findings so far suggest that, in some euro area countries, the correlation between payment data and private consumption is encouragingly strong, making their systematic use in forecasting an option for policymakers', 'Technological progress in exploiting textual information can provide similar benefits', 'Research shows that information extracted from business newspapers can be used to nowcast quarterly GDP growth and outperforms traditional forecasting methods at turning points', '[21]  Similar methodologies can also be used to extract information on how central bank communication is perceived by the public', 'Specifically, text mining techniques are employed by the ECB to determine whether its communication has been interpreted as dovish or hawkish by the media and to assess its impact in unconventional times', '[22] Given the increasing role of communication in determining the monetary policy stance, such analysis may usefully complement the feedback extracted from financial markets', 'Challenges in using big data for policy analysis Overall, these examples highlight the fact that big data can help policymakers overcome some of the shortcomings of traditional macroeconomic time series', 'In short, these are: improved timeliness, richer detail on interactions and the ability to test and develop old and new theories using data not previously available', 'For sure, big data have also provided plenty of opportunities to deepen our understanding of behavioural economics, and how psychology can drive macroeconomic developments', 'At the same time, some of the data raise new challenges, many – but not all – of them are related to the statistical production process itself', 'For example, the sheer scale and variety of big data result in the difficulty of processing unstructured data', 'The database interfaces used by central banks were designed in the past mainly to handle time series data', 'Strides have certainly been made to cope with cross-sectional data, such as those used in supervision', 'But putting in place effective data processing methods and interfaces that permit the retrieval and visualisation of big data represents a considerable IT challenge', 'It is also a challenge in term of human resources', 'When recruiting staff, central banks have not traditionally sought experience with techniques developed to cope with big data', 'Building up expertise in this new field takes time, and it also involves strategic planning on the recruitment side', 'But central banks are not the only employers wanting these skills, and competing against the private sector for the limited pool of highly sought-after experts is likely to prove challenging', 'Apart from these operational considerations, there are also analytical, legal and ethical concerns related to the use of such data', 'For example, perennial pitfalls involved in analysing traditional data also apply to big data', 'One misconception about big data is the common view that we no longer need to concern ourselves with sample bias, as large volumes of data take precedence over standard sampling theory, and that such data provide a census', '[23]  Any statistician will know that this is of course not true', 'Take a dataset that includes all tweets ever made', 'Despite being a census of tweets, people who tweet are likely to differ in age, preferences and behaviour from those that do not, so several segments of the population are underrepresented, or do not appear in the sample', 'Making assumptions about household behaviour without adequately re-weighting the sample is likely to result in biased and inaccurate estimates', 'Traditional datasets, designed to be representative of the entire population, might therefore sometimes be less subject to sample biases, although they are significantly smaller in size', 'Similarly, big data also involve analytical challenges related to, for example, econometric identification', 'This is also referred to as the “curse of dimensionality”, (sometimes called the “large p, small n paradigm”) where there are many parameters but few observations', '[24] Dynamic factor models, or Bayesian shrinkage, are methods which can help address the difficulties arising from the high dimensionality of data and, in fact, the term “big data” first appeared in econometrics in 2000 in relation to these models', '[25] But some of these methods are still being developed, in particular for cases involving many observations – a situation which we will increasingly face over time as our datasets grow even larger', 'Furthermore, the ability of big data to link individuals across various datasets raises important questions about privacy and confidentiality', 'A special Eurobarometer survey in 2015 showed that two-thirds of respondents were concerned about not having complete control over the information they provided online', 'A quarter of respondents considered it a risk that personal information could be shared with third parties, such as government agencies', 'With this in mind, the European Parliament in April last year approved the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will come into force in May 2018', 'This Regulation will provide strong personal data protection, while giving individuals greater control over their own data', '[26] But statistical agencies and central banks are already taking serious steps to ensure that privacy standards are fully upheld when they make use of new big data, such as credit card transactions or Google search data', 'Anonymity in transaction data helps build trust and allows policymakers to leverage new technology to help take better policy decisions for the common good', 'Differences in national data protection regulations, in turn, together with differences in data standards, also pose a challenge, in the form of our global ability to collect, aggregate, disseminate and share data', 'In today’s interconnected world, a global approach to data collection is a prerequisite for developing a coherent view of the global economy and financial system, and for identifying vulnerabilities', 'But many legal hurdles to cross-border data sharing remain to be overcome, and implementation gaps to be filled, if the intended benefits of the data harmonisation reforms in the financial field are to be fully achieved', '[27]  Regulation also plays a big role in decisions about accessibility', 'Consider the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which will enter into force in a few weeks', 'One outcome of the new Directive is that banks will soon lose the monopoly they have on their customers’ transaction data', 'The implication is that new fintech firms will be able to use these data to design new tailor-made products and to allow real-time access to financial services anywhere and at any time', 'This can be expected to foster productivity', 'At the same time, regulators need to be mindful of the potential financial stability implications, in particular if incumbents fail to rise to the challenge, and fintech firms thus start to crowd banks out of a large range of financial services', 'Granting access to big data therefore also has the potential to shift economic structures', '[28]  It even has the potential to change the course of policy', 'So far, policy has largely relied on data produced by governments, often in the form of abstract concepts, such as GDP', '[29] But the more widespread ability to create individual statistics threatens the hegemony of policymakers in defining the parameters of policy', 'One risk is that individuals will use other, readily available sources of data that could undermine confidence in official statistics and, hence, in the central bank’s commitment to price stability', 'Just as there are concerns about “fake news” dominating social media, there is a risk of “fake”, or at least poor quality, statistics driving out better quality ones in public discourse', 'And just as false reports may quickly go viral, reliance on internet search data in the assessment of the economic situation may become self-fulfilling', 'Actions by economic agents could become less anchored to actual activity and more prone to manias and panics, with obvious implications for economic and financial stability', 'The challenges here are twofold for policymakers', 'The first is to meet the demand for more individually tailored information', 'Some statistical offices, for example, already offer the possibility to calculate a personalised inflation index using official price quotes, but with expenditure weights provided by the user', 'The second challenge is to recognise that public perceptions of what we should target may differ from the abstract definitions we employ', 'Over time, engagement with the public may result in changes to definitions, and even in the conduct of policy', 'This brings me to my last challenge, which has a philosophical dimension to it', 'Over time major central banks have tended to become more transparent, in the belief that communication would aid the effectiveness of monetary policy', '[30] This has led to growing interaction between central banks and financial markets, simply because communication is not a one-way street', 'You can see what I’m getting at', 'New technological advances may create a new “monkey in the mirror” mimetic loop[31], this time not through financial markets, but through big data', 'That is, we may one day be tempted to draft our monetary policy statements and speeches in the light of how they will be comprehended and interpreted by artificial intelligence algorithms', 'So in the future big data may work two ways, with central banks acting on, and reacting to, it, with consequences which remain to be understood', 'Conclusion Let me conclude', 'Central banks have made considerable progress in recent years in integrating big new datasets into their policy analysis and decision-making', 'Granular data collected by central banks themselves have, in particular, become an indispensable source of information for policymakers', 'Yet, it is probably fair to say that we are still exploring how to use much of the big data that new technology opens up to us', 'Although evidence is growing that online data may provide tangible benefits for short-term forecasting, more research is needed to ensure that the data are of sufficient quality and reliability to systematically inform policymaking', 'The potential of such data to enrich central bank analysis in the future is considerable, however, as are the challenges that come along with it', 'For this reason, I encourage all of you to continue your efforts

      " list(['Going negative: the ECB’s experience   Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Roundtable on Monetary Policy, Low Interest Rates and Risk Taking at the 35th Congress of the European Economic Association In June 2014, the ECB was the first major central bank to lower one of its key interest rates into negative territory', '[1] As experience with negative interest rates was scant, the ECB proceeded cautiously over time, lowering the deposit facility rate (DFR) in small increments of 10\\xa0basis points, until it reached -0', '5% in September 2019', 'While negative interest rates have, over time, become a standard instrument in the ECB’s toolkit, they remain controversial, both in central banking circles and academia', '[2]  In my remarks today, I will review the ECB’s experience with its negative interest rate policy (NIRP)', 'I will argue that the transmission of negative rates has worked smoothly and that, in combination with other policy measures, they have been effective in stimulating the economy and raising inflation', 'On balance, the positive effects of the NIRP have exceeded their side effects, in particular when taking into account the compensating effects of other policy innovations, such as the two-tier system and our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs)', 'At the same time, like with other unconventional policy measures, side effects are likely to increase over time, if the negative interest rate environment were to persist for too long', 'As negative rates are, by and large, a reflection of broader slow-moving adverse macroeconomic trends, the pandemic is a wake-up call for governments to foster innovation and potential growth, and to reap the benefits from further European integration', 'Setting the scene Over the past few decades, the global macroeconomic environment has changed in ways that pose significant challenges to the conduct of monetary policy', 'Sustained demographic shifts, global excess savings and a slowdown in productivity growth have all contributed to a secular decline in the real equilibrium rate of interest over the last 20\\xa0years in most advanced economies, though estimates are fraught with a considerable degree of uncertainty (Chart 1)', '[3]  Central banks have responded in different ways to the fall in equilibrium rates', 'As the global financial crisis broke and conventional policy space was exhausted, most central banks resorted to forward guidance as a means to provide additional accommodation', 'Some started purchasing government bonds and other securities', 'The ECB, for its part, tailored its non-standard measures to the structure of the euro area economy, where banks play a significant role in credit intermediation', 'In essence, this meant providing ample liquidity for a much longer period than under the ECB’s standard operations', 'In mid-2014, however, when downside risks to the inflation outlook intensified, additional accommodation was required', 'Negative interest rates were a crucial part of the measures that the Governing Council adopted at the time', 'The idea was, broadly speaking, twofold: to trigger a repricing of the expected future path of short-term interest rates by “breaking through” the zero lower bound and to encourage banks to provide more credit to the economy', 'Empirical evidence suggests that negative rates ultimately delivered on both objectives', 'Transmission of monetary policy in an environment of negative policy rates After the DFR was lowered into negative territory, the entire 3-month Euribor forward curve shifted down further and eventually traded fully in negative territory, and it even started to exhibit a slight inversion (Chart 2)', 'In other words, the ECB had succeeded in shifting the perceived lower bound on interest rates firmly into negative territory, supported by forward guidance that left the door open for the possibility of further rate cuts', 'This restored a fundamentally important element of monetary policy: the possibility for the market to anticipate further policy cuts and to thereby frontload policy accommodation', 'The zero lower bound was no longer constraining market expectations', 'As the market started repricing the full expected future interest rate path, the effects of the cut in the DFR extended well beyond short-term rates', 'A decomposition analysis by ECB staff shows that the NIRP contributed to shifting euro area sovereign yields downwards across the full maturity spectrum, with a peak around the five-year segment (Chart 3)', '[4]  These effects were reinforced by a compression of the term premium: negative rates strengthen the incentives of investors to rebalance their portfolios towards longer-dated securities', 'The propagation of a rate cut in negative territory was therefore materially stronger along the yield curve than for a conventional rate cut, which typically has very little impact on longer maturities', 'Negative interest rates reinforced the effects of our asset purchases for the same reasons: when banks’ excess reserves are remunerated at negative rates, there is a strong incentive to reduce them by shifting into riskier assets, such as longer-dated government bonds', '[5] This strengthens the portfolio rebalancing channel of asset purchases', 'This “hot potato effect” also extends to bank loans, which was the second objective of lowering rates into negative territory', 'With the start of negative rates, we have observed a steady increase in the growth rate of loans extended by euro area monetary financial institutions (Chart 4)', 'An ECB meta-analysis of various studies corroborates the view that the use of the NIRP had a positive impact on loan growth', '[6] The analysis shows that, since the start of the NIRP regime in mid-2014, the growth of loans extended to non-financial corporations (NFCs) would have been lower in the vast majority of counterfactual scenarios of non-negative policy rates (Chart 5)', 'In addition, several empirical studies exploiting bank-level data confirmed the causal link between negative policy rates and loan growth', '[7]  Taken together, these findings suggest that the lowering of policy rates into negative territory fostered monetary policy transmission in the euro area, as evidenced by the strong pass-through from policy rates to market rates and higher loan growth', 'Effect of negative policy rates on bank profitability and bank lending In spite of these positive effects on the effectiveness of monetary policy, the NIRP has often been criticised for its potential side effects, particularly on the banking sector', 'Since banks are generally reluctant to pass on negative rates to their retail clients, mainly for competitive, but also for legal reasons, the funding conditions of deposit-taking institutions typically fail to drop in tandem with the decline in lending rates', 'This affects banks’ interest margins and hence profitability', 'This effect is particularly pronounced for banks with a high deposit-to-asset ratio', 'Financial market participants seem to have internalised this constraint', 'Studies document that a surprise hike in the policy rate has a negative effect on banks’ stock prices in normal times, but a positive effect in an environment of negative policy rates, which is increasing in the dependence of banks on deposits as a source of funding (Chart 6)', '[8]  In the extreme, the effect could be such that banks charge higher interest rates on their lending activities, thereby reversing the intended accommodative effect of monetary policy', 'That is, the zero lower bound has been replaced by an “effective lower bound”, which coincides closely with the so-called “reversal rate”, which indicates the level at which additional policy cuts would start to become contractionary, or the rate where holding cash, net of storage and security costs, would become more attractive than holding bank deposits', '[9]  There is considerable uncertainty as to the precise level of the “reversal rate” and current estimates suggest that the ECB has not reached the effective lower bound', 'Yet, data on the volume of overnight deposits held by households in the euro area confirm the negligible pass-through of negative policy rates to banks’ retail deposit rates (Chart 7)', 'As a result, only a very small proportion of retail deposits are currently remunerated at negative rates (Chart 8)', 'By contrast, banks more frequently charge negative rates on deposits held by NFCs', '[10] Within the euro area, this primarily applies to Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands (Chart 9)', 'There is also evidence that negative rates affect a growing proportion of the deposits held by NFCs, suggesting that the pass-through associated with negative policy rates has increased gradually over time (Chart 10)', 'This is in line with empirical studies that demonstrate that the pass-through from policy rates to corporate deposit rates intensifies as rates become more negative', 'This induces firms to decrease their cash holdings through investments, thus supporting the standard monetary policy transmission mechanism', '[11]  Interest rate margins, however, are only one part of banks’ profitability', 'Even though banks are reluctant to pass on negative rates to retail clients, and have only cautiously started doing so for firms, the impact of negative rates on banks’ profitability is much broader', 'In particular, by stimulating aggregate demand, negative rates have measurably contributed to an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, thereby enhancing credit quality', 'As a result, according to ECB staff analysis based on a sample of large euro area banks, the NIRP had a negligible effect on bank profitability over the period from 2014 to 2019 (Chart 11)', '[12] The negative effects from lower net interest income and the charge on excess reserves were broadly compensated by a reduction in loan-loss provisions', 'In addition, two additional policy measures by the ECB have actively contributed to mitigating the impact of negative rates on bank profitability with a view to protecting the bank lending channel', 'The first is the adoption of a two-tier system through which a significant portion of excess reserves are exempt from negative rates', 'The second is our TLTROs through which banks can secure borrowing at highly favourable rates, provided they extend sufficient credit to the real economy', 'In other words, the introduction of a “dual rate” system, where the pricing of TLTROs deviates from our key policy rate, directly lowers the funding conditions of banks and thereby compensates part of the costs that banks accrue by not being able to pass on negative rates to some of their customer base', 'Effect of negative policy rates on bank risk-taking A second concern is the effect of negative policy rates on banks’ risk-taking behaviour, induced by a search for yield', 'A number of recent studies investigate the risk-taking behaviour of banks in an environment of negative policy rates', 'For example, Heider, Saidi and Schepens (2019) show that the introduction of negative policy rates by the ECB induced high-deposit banks to incur more risk by lending to borrowers with a larger return-on-assets (ROA) variation than low-deposit banks (Chart 12)', '[13] But even though the borrowers of high-deposit banks show a higher volatility of returns, they exhibit lower levels of leverage and the same level of profitability as the borrowers of low-deposit banks', 'In a similar vein, Bubeck, Maddaloni and Peydró (2019) investigate how negative policy rates affect banks’ investment choices in their securities portfolios', '[14] The authors find that high-deposit banks tend to increase their holdings of high-yield securities in an environment of negative deposit rates, especially relative to low-deposit banks (Chart\\xa013)', 'These search-for-yield effects are stronger for less capitalised banks, which could raise concerns for financial stability', 'Bittner et al', '(2020) also consider the real economic effects of negative rates', '[15] On the basis of credit register data, they provide empirical evidence that the borrowers of high-deposit banks in Germany, where the pass-through of negative rates is limited, are riskier but that they increase investment and employment more strongly after receiving credit, thereby supporting monetary transmission to the real economy', 'It is precisely through such effects that higher risk-taking by banks may be a feature rather than a bug, as long as it does not raise financial stability concerns', 'A longer-term perspective In spite of the overall positive assessment of the ECB’s experience with negative interest rates, a persistent period of negative rates may pose additional challenges', 'It cannot be taken for granted that negative effects on bank profitability from depressed profit margins can be compensated by lower loan-loss provisions also in the future', 'Research based on a broad sample of pandemics by Jordà, Singh and Taylor (2020) suggests that pandemics were typically followed by a long period of depressed economic growth and a sustained drop in the real natural rate of interest (Chart 14)', '[16]  This implies that, absent a forceful policy response, the current pandemic is likely to put substantial pressure on banks’ profitability due to rising loan-loss provisions and defaults, at a time when euro area banks’ profitability is already depressed, mostly due to structural reasons (Chart 15)', '[17]  While the ECB can mitigate potential negative effects, solutions to the underlying structural causes go beyond the remit of monetary policy', 'These problems include problems of overbanking and a lack of pan-European mergers, which would require the completion of the European Banking Union, as well as the advancement of the capital markets union, which have become ever more important in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic', 'The medium- to long-term growth outlook after the pandemic will depend to a large extent on whether public spending at national and European level, mainly through the European Recovery Fund, is used wisely to foster the euro area’s growth potential, and thereby to raise real equilibrium rates, in particular through investments that foster the transition to a carbon-free and more digitalised economy', '[18]  Concluding remarks Let me conclude by emphasising three key points', 'First, the ECB’s negative interest rate policy has been successful in turning the zero lower bound into an effective lower bound well below zero and supporting bank lending', 'This fundamentally improved monetary transmission and helped to stimulate the economy and raise inflation', 'Second, negative rates can have side effects on banks’ profitability and risk-taking behaviour', 'That said, the experience of the euro area over the past few years suggests that the positive effects dominated, supported by the use of other policy measures that directly mitigate the costs of negative rates', 'Finally, side effects are likely to become more relevant over time', 'Since negative rates largely reflect adverse macroeconomic trends outside the remit of central banks, a forceful policy response by governments to the pandemic is indispensable for raising potential growth, thereby paving the way for positive interest rates in the future', 'Thank you for your attention', 'I would like to thank Florian Heider and Alejandro van der Ghote for their contributions to this speech',

      " list(['Ladies and Gentlemen [1], I would like first to thank Paris Europlace for inviting me to speak today', 'Every year, this conference offers the opportunity to take a closer look at the challenges for the European financial sector that have been thrown up by the crisis', 'They come under three headings: deleveraging, fragmentation, recession', 'And all three are interrelated', 'As banks, households and governments deleverage, some economies in the euro area are being affected more than others', 'Financial conditions across the monetary union have diverged significantly, and resulted in large cross-country dispersion in loan dynamics', 'Financial fragmentation, uncertainty and a subdued macro environment have also manifested themselves in a contraction of investment, which is currently the most important drag on growth in the euro area', 'In the first quarter of 2013, investment in the euro area was 22 % below its pre-crisis level in 2007 Q2', 'This year, the European Commission expects investment to further contract by 2', '6%, or 0', '5% of euro area GDP', 'So, if the principal answer to the crisis is a return to growth, a core concern has to be how to revive credit provision in all parts of the euro area', 'I will today discuss in turn the role of three key factors in that respect: monetary policy, Banking Union and financial market structure', 'The role of monetary policy Let me start with the role of monetary policy', 'Throughout the crisis, the ECB has played an important role to ensure, within its price stability mandate, the proper financing of the euro area economy in a context of subdued credit dynamics', 'First, we have reduced our main interest rates to historic lows', 'We have narrowed the interest rate corridor to 50 basis points which helps reduce fragmentation between banks that rely on ECB liquidity and those that can borrow in the interbank market', 'And last week, unanimously, the Governing Council took the important step to introduce forward guidance within our two pillar monetary strategy', 'We expect the key interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time', 'Consistently, liquidity will remain ample', 'Second, we have introduced a series of measures to ensure that banks can pass on these low interest rates in the real economy, in particular where they are needed the most', 'These include providing as much liquidity as they need to euro area banks, reviewing our collateral framework, lengthening the maturity of our operations to three years when euro area banks were facing severe funding stress, and removing redenomination risks in financial markets through our announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT)', 'These measures have resulted in a significant reduction of financial fragmentation in practically all market segments', 'For example, since the OMT announcement, spreads on investment grade corporate bonds fell by 70 basis points in the euro area, while spreads on high-yield corporate bonds decreased by around 300 basis points [2]', 'The cost of both deposit and bond funding for banks has also fallen significantly', 'In addition, banks’ reliance on Eurosystem funding has decreased, as reflected in the repayments to date of 60% of the circa EUR 500 billion injected in net terms into the banking system by our two very long-term refinancing operations', 'Target2 balances have been reduced by EUR 320 billions, or nearly 30%, since their peak level of July 2012', 'However, the improvement in financial conditions has not yet been fully reflected on the real side of the economy', 'Loans to households are stagnating and credit to non-financial corporations is receding', 'There is still significant heterogeneity between financing conditions in stressed and non-stressed countries', 'While the ECB cut it main refinancing rate by 50 basis point in the twelve months before end-May 2013, the rate charged by banks on non-financial corporations went down by 25 basis points in Spain and less than 20 basis points in Portugal', '[3]  This reflects the fact that monetary policy is only one factor that matters for financing of the real economy', 'Another crucial factor is confidence in the banking sector', 'The role of Banking Union Euro area large and complex banking groups have increased their median core Tier 1 capital ratio from 8', '3% at the end of 2009 to 9', '6% at the end of 2011 and 11', '1% in the first quarter of this year, and their leverage has improved considerably, mainly through capital increases', 'Yet, price-to-book ratios remain less than 1 for many institutions', 'This reveals persistent lack of trust by financial market participants in their true solvency positions and their underlying asset quality', 'Banking Union is a key part of restoring that trust', 'How governments intervene in systemic banking crises is critical', 'Bank restructuring measures that provide banks with incentives to liquidate or restructure bad loans, while allowing for sufficient recapitalisation, significantly accelerate the recovery from recessions related to banking crises', '[4]  This suggests that Banking Union can help boost credit provision through two key channels', 'First, by increasing transparency over the quality of banks’ assets, which is key to distinguish strong from weak banks and hence remove the concerns hanging over the whole banking sector', 'Second, by ensuring that banks that are not in position to lend can be restructured or resolved without creating financial instability', 'These two channels correspond to the two main elements of Banking Union: the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM)', 'The SSM should be established later in 2013 and start operating twelve months later as a single system, with a common supervisory manual applying to all participating banks, and the ECB directly supervising larger banks', 'Generally, the SSM should reduce concerns over hidden losses by creating common oversight of risks in the euro area banking sector and reducing regulatory forbearance', 'Specifically, before the ECB takes over its tasks as single supervisor, it will undertake a rigorous balance sheet assessment of the banks it will directly supervise, including an asset quality review', 'The assessment will be undertaken together with national supervisory agencies and, as needed, with external consultants', 'In case it reveals capital shortfalls, it is the responsibility of the banks to raise capital themselves', 'As acknowledged by the European Council, public backstops will ensure that any remaining shortfalls are filled', 'Such backstops can be provided at national or, as last resort, at euro area level', 'Regarding the SRM, the legal framework for resolution contained in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) creates a stronger set of tools for winding down failing banks in the future', 'By ensuring that bail-in must precede bail-out, the BRRD achieves a level playing field and reduces financial fragmentation linked to the strength of national budgets', 'Moreover, in the transition to the BRRD, and as of next month, new State aid rules will require the burden-sharing of losses by shareholders and creditors, if resolution actions involve public funds', 'This will ensure that shareholders and creditors are the first to bear losses, and not the taxpayers', 'But it is key, particularly for cross-border banks, that there is a strong central authority that can use these tools in a swift and impartial manner', 'The ECB has been clear that we need a single European resolution authority and a single resolution fund as a fundamental complement to the SSM', 'I welcome the proposal of the European Commission in this respect and will assess it in detail', 'The plan that the SRM comes into force in 2014 and can start its operations as from January 2015, when the BRRD enters into force, is also welcomed', 'Banking Union is about restoring the single market for capital', 'European companies should be able to tap a single pool of savings to fund their global expansion', 'Banking Union will ensure that the funding cost of a bank depends on the quality of its assets, not on the jurisdiction in which its headquarters are located', 'There might be fundamental reasons why Portuguese SMEs do not borrow under the same terms as German SMEs', 'But they should borrow under the same terms from Portuguese and from German banks', 'The role of market structures However, even if Banking Union can reduce financial fragmentation across countries, it may not, by itself, be sufficient to reduce it within countries – as epitomised by the significant mark-up on loans paid by SMEs compared with larger firms', 'Indeed, according to the results of the ECB survey on the access to finance of SMEs in the euro area, conducted in February-March 2013, 16% of SMEs (that is more than 2 million) report access to finance as their main problem', 'Furthermore, interest rate spreads on SME loans compared with those for large non-financial companies have widened to an average of 40 basis points since 2010', 'This links to the third factor in restoring credit provision: improving market structures, in particular to help specific sectors like SMEs', 'The ECB has supported the EIB and European Commission in examining the constraints hindering the development of securitisation instruments for SME loans and the revival of the ABS market', 'We welcome the on-going work by the Commission and the EIB on joint risk-sharing instruments to support SME lending, which would combine the EU budget resources with the EIB and the EIF lending capacity [5]', 'The European Council has supported this initiative and called for these instruments to begin operating in January 2014', 'In parallel, a more balanced regulatory treatment for ABS, acknowledging the past credit performance of these instruments, would ensure a level playing field with other securities regarding risk, rating and maturity', 'The ECB can support the revival of the ABS market, provided that the risk to the Eurosystem is controllable, and the underlying instruments are simple and transparent', 'But it cannot be a substitute for market mechanism, nor can it subsidise risk taking of market participants', 'Concluding remarks Let me now conclude', 'Reviving credit growth is one of the most pressing challenges for the euro area today, but it can only be achieved by all actors playing their part', 'The role of banks has been reduced after the crisis, and the euro area will probably move towards a more balanced financing mix, with a greater role for arms’ length finance based on capital markets', 'Being more balanced, this model would be more resilient', 'But the euro area is and will remain a bank based economy', 'In fact, there are essential constituencies, namely SMEs and households that still obtain credit almost exclusively from banks', 'Accordingly, there can be no sustained recovery without a healthy, competitive and prudent banking system', 'Cleaning up the banks, as was done at an early stage in the US, is not merely desirable, it is a condition to finally emerge from the crisis and move on', 'The ECB can help reduce divergences in bank funding', 'But governments have to ensure that banks are properly capitalised and that their balance sheets are cleaned up', 'Similarly, the ECB can help support the economy and improve the macroeconomic outlook', 'But governments have to introduce the structural reforms that are essential to open up investment opportunities, and without which banks will not sustainably alter their risk assessments', 'Low interest rates and improved financial market conditions may give a sense that reforms can be deployed over extended periods of time', 'But reforms are a matter of urgency', 'Deleveraging, fragmentation and recession weight on the most vulnerable in society, in particular on the youth', 'Time lost increases the risk of a permanently lower rate of growth and of a lost generation', 'In other words, the key to reviving growth and investment in the euro area is for each stakeholder to take responsibility for what it can change, within its mandate – and then just do it', 'Thank you for your attention', '[1]I wish to thank Jean-Francois Jamet for his contributions to this speech', 'I remain solely responsible for the opinions contained

culmination of a 30-year upswing in the global financial cycle, while the second saw the worst economic and financial crisis since the 1930s', 'But, exceptional as they were, these two periods can teach us some useful lessons about what still needs to be done', 'Monetary Union has succeeded in many ways, but it has not delivered the gains that were expected in all countries', 'This is partly the result of domestic policy choices and partly the result of Monetary Union being incomplete, which led to insufficient stabilisation during the crisis', 'The way ahead, therefore, is to identify the changes that are necessary to make our Monetary Union work for the benefit of all member countries', 'We need to make these changes as soon as possible, but we also need to explain why they are important to the people of Europe', 'The rationale for one market, one money The Single Market is often seen simply as an expression of the globalisation process, which over time has even eliminated exchange rate flexibility', 'But the Single Market and globalisation are not the same thing', 'Globalisation has led to higher overall welfare for all economies, and for emerging markets in particular', 'But it is now clear that the rules that accompanied this process were not sufficient to prevent it from causing severe distortions', 'Open markets have heightened economic insecurity for people exposed to intensified competition, and added to their sense of being “left behind” in a world where the great wealth created has been concentrated in a few hands', 'From the outset, however, the Single Market was designed to reap the benefits of openness while also tempering its costs for the most vulnerable; to promote growth while protecting the people of Europe from the injustices of untrammelled free markets', 'This was undoubtedly also the vision of Jacques Delors, the architect of the Single Market', 'The Single Market was conceived during a period of weakness in the European economy', 'Annual growth had averaged just 2', '2% from 1973 until 1985 in the 12 countries that would go on to form the euro area[1], down from 5', '3% between 1960 and 1973', 'Growth potential had also fallen from about 5% per year at the beginning of the 1970s to around 2% per year by the beginning of the following decade', 'The typical response of governments to low growth was to increase fiscal deficits', 'From 1973 to 1985, public deficits in the euro area 12 averaged 3', '5% of GDP, while in Italy the average was 9% of GDP', 'Unemployment rose from 2', '6% in 1973 to 9', '2% in 1985 for the euro area 12', 'In Italy, it climbed from 5', '9% to 8', '2% over the same period', 'But the EU had a powerful tool at its disposal to raise growth: the common market', 'One reason that growth potential had decelerated was that intra-EU trade growth had stalled in the early 1970s, because the common market covered mainly intermediate goods where growth was already saturated', 'Trade in sectors with high R&D and skill content was restricted by non-tariff barriers, preventing productivity spillovers', '[2]  The Single Market offered a way to remove these barriers, reverse the decline in economic potential, and bring more people back into work', 'Yet the Single Market was never just about this', 'It also aimed to protect people from some of the costs of the changes that would inevitably arise', 'This, in turn, would create a more favourable political environment for advancing the process of European integration, following the setbacks of the 1970s', 'Unlike the wider process of globalisation, the Single Market allowed Europe to impose its values on economic integration – to build a market that, to the extent possible, was free but just', 'Product rules could be used to protect consumers from lax standards in other countries, and protect producers from unfair competition', 'And production rules could be used to protect workers by putting a floor on “social dumping” and upholding labour standards', 'This is why the launch of the Single Market agenda in the mid-1980s went hand in hand with a strengthening of common rule-making in the EU and of powers of judicial review', 'The opening of markets was accompanied by the creation of a strong European authority to safeguard fair competition; product standards became tighter, with the introduction of the geographical indication protections for specific foods, for example', 'And safeguards central to the European social model were progressively embedded in EU law, in areas where the EU had the power to act', 'The Charter of Fundamental Rights has prevented a “race to the bottom” in terms of workers’ rights', 'Legislation was adopted to curtail unfair labour practices, such as the revision of the Posted Workers Directive this year', 'EU legislation also protects those in less secure employment', 'One example is the Directive on part-time work in 1997, which sought equal treatment for part-time and fixed-term employees', 'Last year the EU institutions endorsed the European Pillar of Social Rights to support equal opportunities and access to the labour market, fair working conditions, social protection and inclusion', 'EU legislation has not led to a complete harmonisation of labour protections across Europe', 'But it has meant that the gap in labour standards across countries has gradually narrowed, even as lower-income countries have joined the EU', 'Research finds a process of upward convergence in significant areas of social expenditure in the EU since 1980, although this has tailed off in recent years', '[3] The same cannot be said at the international level', 'But the Single Market required greater exchange rate stability than a free trade area, and this resulted in significant trade-offs for economic policy', 'These were well-articulated by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa in his famous “inconsistent quartet”', '[4] If European countries wanted to have the benefits of managed open trade, they could not simultaneously have capital mobility, independent monetary policy and fixed exchange rates', 'Governments initially responded to this conundrum by maintaining fixed exchange rates and introducing capital controls on short-term flows, which allowed a degree of monetary policy autonomy', 'But as financial integration deepened and capital controls were progressively eliminated during the 1980s, fixed exchange rates became unsustainable', 'Due to the international financial storms raging at the time, the countries that had pegged their currencies to the Deutsche Mark (DM) within the European Monetary System (EMS) had to periodically decide either to maintain an independent monetary policy and devalue, or to maintain parity with the DM and lose any sovereignty over their monetary policy', 'Given the frequency with which policymakers had to make these decisions, some countries lost both the benefits of exchange-rate stability and their monetary policy independence', 'The social costs were high', 'This process came to an end with the ERM crisis in 1992-3, when it ceased to be credible for countries entering a recession to follow German interest rate rises', 'At the same time, devaluing repeatedly was becoming incompatible with the deep Single Market that countries were trying to build', 'Indeed, the prevailing view on devaluations was captured well by Nobel laureate Robert Mundell, who developed his theory of optimal currency areas in the belief that, “I could not see why countries that were in the process of forming a common market should saddle themselves with a new barrier to trade in the form of uncertainty about exchange rates”', '[5] Exchange rate flexibility would have undermined the Single Market in two ways', 'First, it would have weakened incentives for firms to raise productivity, because they could have lifted competitiveness – if only temporarily – by devaluing rather than increasing output per head', '[6] Yet Europe had witnessed time and again that such actions did not lead to lasting welfare gains', 'From the launch of the EMS in 1979 to the ERM crisis in 1992, the Italian lira was devalued seven times against the DM, losing around half of its value cumulatively vis-à-vis the German currency', 'Yet average annual productivity growth[7] in Italy was lower than in the euro area 12 over this period, Italy’s GDP growth rate was roughly the same as that of its European peers, and its unemployment rate went up by 1', '3 percentage points', 'At the same time, consumer prices in Italy grew cumulatively by 223%, compared with 103% in the euro area 12', '[8]  Second, support for the Single Market would be undermined in the long run if firms that did invest in raising productivity could be deprived of some of the benefits by “beggar-thy-neighbour” behaviour through competitive devaluations in other countries', 'Open markets would not have lasted', 'Europe had experienced the problems created by exchange rate flexibility in the 1960s with the common agricultural market', 'Absent a single currency, the common agricultural policy was based on prices quoted in units of account', 'But successive currency crises, in particular a revaluation of the DM and a devaluation of the French franc in 1969, jeopardised trust in the market, as the farmers affected demanded compensation for their losses', 'The issue was smoothed over by introducing monetary compensatory amounts to mitigate sudden changes in farm prices caused by abrupt adjustments in exchange rates', 'But the system proved difficult to implement and sustain as it was virtually impossible to avoid distortions of production and trade, which poisoned intra-Community relations', '[9]  So, faced with an “inconsistent quartet” of policy choices, a single currency provided, at least in principle, a way to resolve them', 'It would allow countries to maintain stable exchange rates and therefore benefit from openness within the Single Market, while managing as far as possible its costs', 'Not all countries that had joined the Single Market also joined the euro, of course', 'Some countries, such as Denmark, pegged their exchange rates to the euro', 'For other countries, the Single Market represented the gateway to the euro', 'Five additional countries[10] joined the euro in its first decade and three more in its second, but other smaller economies have stayed out so far', 'Finally, there is the United Kingdom, the only large economy inside the Single Market that chose to stay out of the euro area', 'The United Kingdom is a particular case, not only for political reasons but also for structural reasons, such as the relatively low exchange rate pass-through it had in the past', '[11]  The benefits of one market, one money today We should consider what gains have been made as a result of having one market with one money', 'With the euro protecting the Single Market, trade growth has increased, with intra-EU exports rising from 13% of EU GDP in 1992 to 20% today', 'Intra-euro area trade has risen both in absolute terms and as a share of total trade with advanced economies[12], even as emerging market economies have entered the global market', 'Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows within Europe have also grown[13], with inflows from the rest of the EU to Italy increasing by 36% from 1992 to 2010', '[14]  Behind the growth of intra-EU trade lies perhaps an even more important development, which is the much closer intertwining of European economies through the deepening of value chains', 'Since the start of the 2000s, supply chain linkages between countries within the EU have intensified at a faster pace and were more resilient during the crisis, compared with their supply chain linkages with countries outside the Single Market', '[15]  The removal of customs barriers as part of the Single Market agenda has facilitated multiple border crossings during the production process', 'Europe-wide standards have boosted intra-EU value chains by providing more certainty for firms about the quality of production in other countries and encouraging the fragmentation of the production process that is typical of value chains', '[16] And the single currency has further enhanced the process by eliminating the costs of foreign exchange payments and settlements and of hedging exchange rate risk', 'Participation in these value chains has brought gains for all countries, especially in terms of productivity spillovers', 'The imported inputs used in value chains generate a tangible boost to productivity', '[17] And higher productivity in turn leads to higher wages', 'Integration within value chains is associated with an increase in hourly compensation for all skill groups', '[18]  Moreover, integrating into value chains has improved risk-sharing among European countries, since it has allowed the gains (and losses) of trade with the rest of the world to be more evenly spread', 'Within the EU, close to 20% of export-supported jobs are located in a country other than the one that exports the final product', '[19]  Around half a million Italian workers are involved in the production processes of companies located in other EU countries that export to the rest of the world', '[20] Italian firms themselves participate strongly in global value chains and this is positively associated with labour productivity', '[21]  It is often this link to value chains that allows in particular the SMEs that are so typical of Italy’s manufacturing sector to survive and grow', 'In a world that is increasingly dominated by scale, this permits Italy to retain one of its fundamental characteristics', 'Italy, through the Single Market and the single currency, is deeply integrated into the European production process', 'The closer intertwining of European economies has had two significant effects on exchange rate relationships for euro area countries  First, the cost of not being able to devalue within Monetary Union has fallen', 'ECB analysis finds that misalignments of real effective exchange rates are smaller – albeit more persistent – for euro area countries than those between advanced economies or countries linked by pegged exchange rates, and these misalignments have actually become smaller in the second decade of EMU relative to the first decade', '[22]  At the same time, value chains have blunted the short-run benefits of competitive devaluations', '[23] Since exports contain a greater share of imports, any boost to external demand associated with a hypothetical devaluation is now offset by higher input costs from imported intermediates', 'As a result, participation in value chains has been found to reduce the responsiveness of export volumes to movements in the exchange rate', '[24]  So, any country hypothetically looking to devalue to regain competitiveness would have to do so to a much larger extent than was necessary in previous decades', 'And devaluations of such size would not only threaten the existence of the Single Market', 'They would also result in a substantial loss of welfare within the country carrying out the devaluation owing to the greater negative impact it would have via higher import prices', 'And studies on non-EU countries suggest that the welfare loss would be greatest for the poorest in society, since poorer households tend to spend a larger share of their income on tradeable goods than richer households', '[25] This is also typically the case in euro area countries', 'But does being outside the euro provide additional benefits in terms of monetary policy sovereignty', 'This is not so obvious', 'First, the single currency has actually allowed countries to regain monetary sovereignty compared with the fixed exchange rate regimes of the past', 'Decision-making over monetary policy, which effectively belonged to Germany under the EMS, is now shared among all euro area countries', 'And the size of euro financial markets has made the euro area less vulnerable to US spillovers, even as global financial integration has accelerated', 'Second, it is worth noting that the supposed advantages of monetary sovereignty – such as the ability to engage in monetary financing of government spending – do not appear to be valued highly by countries that are members of the Single Market but not the euro', 'Such countries have a weighted average public debt of 68% of GDP (44% of GDP if the United Kingdom is excluded), compared with 89% for countries that use the single currency', 'In any case, as the history of Italy has shown, monetary financing of government debt did not lead to real long-term benefits', '[26] In periods where debt monetisation was more common in Italy, such as in the 1970s, maintaining a growth rate similar to its European peers required repeated devaluations', 'Inflation reached unsustainable levels and hit the most vulnerable in society', 'Convergence and divergence in the euro area But if it is true that the supposed advantages associated with the freedom of being outside Monetary Union belong to a memory that has been obscured by time and the dramas of the recent crisis, it is also true that in some countries various benefits that were expected from EMU have not yet materialised', 'It was not mistaken, and nor is it today, to expect higher growth and employment to emerge from the “culture of stability” that Monetary Union would bring about', 'But it was inconceivable that joining Monetary Union alone would be sufficient to achieve this', 'We needed and continue to need much more', 'To the founders of EMU, it was clear that establishing a well-functioning monetary union would be a long and gradual process', 'Historical experience suggested that opening markets could lead to differentiated gains, with some regions profiting more than others', 'This had been the experience of both Italy and Germany after unification in the 19th century', '[27]  Several euro area countries have achieved significant convergence, particularly the Baltic countries, Slovakia and, to a lesser extent, Malta and Slovenia', 'In these countries, the gap between real GDP per capita and the euro area mean has been reduced by around one-third since 1999', '[28]  Others that also started far from the euro area average – such as Portugal and Greece – have on balance been unable to close the gap considerably', 'But such divergences are not exclusive to the euro area', 'GDP per capita in the richest state in the United States is around twice that of the poorest state, which is roughly the same gap as in the euro area', '[29] And the dispersion of growth rates across euro area countries has fallen considerably over time and, since 2014, has been comparable to the dispersion across US states', 'So what has driven the different convergence trajectory of countries, and how much is it related to membership of the euro', 'Convergence can be thought of in two ways', 'The first is convergence of real GDP per capita levels', 'This is a long-term process which is driven by factors such as rates of FDI, productivity growth and institutional quality', 'Such factors can be fostered by sharing a single currency, but they are not determined by it', 'Domestic policies, structural and institutional reforms, and contributions from EU structural funds are what play a crucial role here', 'The second concept of convergence relates to growth rates, i', 'e', 'how much business cycles across countries are synchronised, especially when major shocks hit', 'This is determined more by monetary union membership, since the design of a monetary union affects the capacity of countries to adjust and stabilise demand during recessions', 'In the case of Italy, we see both long-term and cyclical factors at play', 'Between 1990 and 1999 – that is, before the introduction of the euro – Italy already had the lowest cumulative per capita GDP growth of the original euro area members', 'From 1999 to 2008, it again had the lowest per capita GDP growth of all euro area members', 'From 2008 to 2017, it recorded the second lowest cumulative growth, behind Greece', 'And, if we look further back, the growth we saw in the 1980s was borrowed from the future, having been based on debt that was left for future generations to bear', 'So, low growth in Italy is a phenomenon that dates back a very long time before the euro', 'This is a supply-side problem, which is clear if one looks at regional performance', 'There is a correlation between GDP per capita in different Italian regions and some structural indicators, such as – just to take an example – the ease of doing business index compiled by the World Bank: the values for the poorer regions are generally lower than those of richer regions', 'At the same time, the fact that Italy – and other countries – diverged further from the euro area average during the crisis highlights two important points', 'First, that structurally weaker countries are more vulnerable to economic slowdowns than others; and second, that our Monetary Union remains incomplete in some key respects', 'There is a fair amount of evidence that countries that implemented decisive structural policies recovered faster from the crisis than others', 'In countries that made such changes, the labour market is now more responsive to growth,[30] and the improved economic conditions have led to gains in employment', '[31]\\xa0But alongside structural policies, different layers of protection are necessary to ensure that countries can stabilise their economies during crises', 'Without appropriate backstops at the euro area level, individual countries in a monetary union can be exposed to self-fulfilling dynamics in sovereign debt markets', 'Such overshooting can aggravate adverse debt dynamics in downturns, inducing procyclicality in national fiscal policies, as we saw in 2011-12', 'Typically, sovereign borrowing costs should fall in a recession, but at that time economies representing one-third of euro area GDP saw their borrowing costs become positively correlated with risk aversion', '[32] The result was a lack of stabilisation that harmed both growth and fiscal sustainability', 'So it is the structurally weaker countries that most need EMU to have instruments to diversify the risk of crises and counteract their effect on the economy', 'I have talked before about how countries like Italy, which had been weakened by decades of low growth and had no fiscal space when the crisis began, saw a crisis of confidence in government debt turn into a credit crisis with major repercussions for employment and growth', '[33]  Deepening private risk-sharing through financial markets is one key element in preventing such events from recurring', 'In the United States, around 70% of shocks are mitigated and shared across the individual states through integrated financial markets, whereas in the euro area the share is only 25%', '[34] It is therefore also in the interest of the weaker countries in the euro area to complete banking union and to proceed with the construction of a genuine capital market', 'But national budgets will never lose their function as the main stabilisation tool during crises', 'In the euro area, around 50% of an unemployment shock is absorbed through the automatic stabilisers in national public budgets, significantly more than in the United States', '[35]\\xa0The use of automatic stabilisers, however, depends on countries not being constrained by their debt level', 'So the necessary fiscal space will have to be created again so that budget interventions can be made in the event of a crisis', 'Yet national fiscal policies also need a complement at the European level', 'We need an institutional architecture that gives all countries the necessary support to ensure that their economies are not exposed to procyclical market behaviour during downturns', 'This will only be possible if the support is temporary and does not constitute a permanent transfer between countries, which would result in a failure to put in place the necessary fiscal consolidation, let alone the fundamental structural reforms needed for a return to growth', 'Conclusion  It is not a technocratic desire to see convergence across countries and the smooth functioning of Monetary Union that has led me to frequently mention the importance of structural reforms in recent years', 'Each country has its own reform agenda, but such reforms are the only way to create the conditions for sustainable growth in wages, productivity and employment and to underpin our welfare state', 'In large part these measures have to be undertaken at the national level, but they can be supported at the European level by the recent decisions to launch an instrument for convergence and competitiveness', 'However, to tackle future cyclical crises, the two layers of protection against shocks – the diversification of risk through the private financial system on the one hand, and public countercyclical support through national budgets and the fiscal capacity of the EU budget on the other – need to interact in a complete and efficient manner', 'The more progress we make in completing the banking union and capital markets union, the less urgent – although still necessary – it becomes to construct a fiscal capacity, which could at times serve to complement national stabilisers', 'Inaction on both fronts heightens the fragility of Monetary Union in times of great crisis and the divergence between countries increases', 'It is clear that completing Monetary Union is the best way to prepare the transition to a form of union that is more complete', 'Monetary Union, a necessary consequence of the Single Market, has become an integral and defining aspect – with its symbols and its constraints – of the political project whose central aim is a Europe that is united in freedom, peace, democracy and prosperity', 'It was an exceptional response – or to paraphrase Robert Kagan[36] an anti-historical response – to a century that had seen dictatorships, war and misery, and in that respect was not dissimilar to previous centuries', 'A unified Europe was part of that world order, itself the result of exceptional circumstances, which followed the Second World War', 'The intervening years have confirmed the rationality of the choices made at the European and the global level', 'The challenges that have arisen have become ever more global in nature and need to be tackled together, not alone', 'And this is even more true for Europeans, both at the level of their individual nations and for the continent as a whole: rich but relatively small; strategically exposed, militarily weak', 'Yet today, for many, the memories that inspired those choices seem distant and irrelevant, and the rationale behind them has been undermined by the misery created by the great financial crisis of the past decade', 'It does not matter that we are emerging from the crisis', 'Elsewhere in the world, the fascination with illiberal prescriptions and regimes is spreading; we are seeing little steps back in history', 'And this is why our European project is even more important today', 'It is only by continuing to make progress, freeing up individual energies but also fostering social equity, that we will save it through our democracies, with a unity of purpose', '[1]Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,

      " list(['Three Questions on Monetary Tightening   Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBNomura conferenceTokyo, 26-27 October 2006      Introduction    In the last two years the central banks of the three major currencies have started to increase interest rates again, after a prolonged period of low or decreasing rates', 'The three experiences differ in many dimensions, in particular with respect to timing and pace', 'The Federal Reserve started first, in June 2004, and since then rates have been raised by 425 basis points', 'The European Central Bank started in December 2005, with a 125 basis points increase in less than one year', 'In Japan the process has just started, in July 2006, with a 25 basis points increase from the zero interest rate floor', 'The three episodes have nevertheless some common features', 'In all cases the tightening cycle started from a historically low level of interest rates, both in nominal and real terms', 'At the starting point, the US Federal Fund rate was at 1 per cent in nominal terms and around -2 when deflated by headline inflation', 'The ECB refinancing rate was at 2 per cent in nominal terms and around zero in real terms', 'The Bank of Japan target for the overnight call rate was at zero both in nominal and real terms', 'The fact that the level of the nominal and real interest rate were rather low, compared to historical levels and to underlying economic and monetary conditions (such as the growth of nominal income and the output gap) suggests that at the start of the tightening cycle monetary policy was quite expansionary', 'In other words, the initial level of the interest rate was substantially below the so-called “neutral” level, which is the level of the interest rate that ensures price stability for given underlying conditions, at least in the most plausible scenario', 'Such a low level might have been warranted in the presence of sizeable downside risks, but was unsustainable once these risks receded', 'According to standard macroeconomic analysis, if the interest rate is systematically below its “neutral” level monetary policy is expansionary and might ultimately fuel inflationary pressures', 'Therefore, even if interest rate is raised but remains below the “neutral” level, monetary conditions continue to be expansionary, although to a lesser degree', 'On the basis of these considerations, it would appear that in spite of the recent interest rate increases in the three largest areas monetary conditions have remained significantly expansionary, as confirmed by the ample liquidity conditions prevailing at the global level', 'Rather than a fully-fledged monetary tightening one should thus rather speak of a reduction in the degree of monetary expansion', 'In a tightening cycle central banks have to address three main questions: When to start tightening', 'At what speed tighten', 'When to stop tightening', 'I will try to examine these three questions in light of the most recent experience and taking into account three main problems', 'First, an information problem: how to interpret incoming data to assess and forecast economic developments so as to calibrate the appropriate interest rate response', 'Second, an incentive (or perhaps I should say risk management) problem: how to balance the risk of acting too early or being too late, i', 'e', 'being ahead or behind the curve', 'Third, a communication problem: how to communicate policy decisions and intentions to the market and the public, especially in light of uncertainty about underlying economic developments, to promote predictability and safeguard the credibility of the central bank', 'These challenges are not independent and may actually compound, as I shall discuss in more detail later', 'Let’s examine the three questions in turn', 'Let me clarify from the start that the purpose of these considerations is to try develop a conceptual framework, based largely on the recent experience, rather than to provide indications about future monetary policy developments, in particular for the euro area', 'Indeed, the future might provide us with new insights, which have not been taken into account and that might lead to a reconsideration of this analysis', 'When to start tightening', 'It is well known that monetary policy implies long and variable transmission lags and that the lags are longer for inflation than for output', 'This implies that an optimal monetary policy tightening should start some quarters ahead of the upswing', 'If we start from a situation of negative excess demand, in which economic activity is lower than potential (negative output gap), the expectation of output growing above potential (so that the output gap closes) should trigger the start of tightening', 'If the central bank fails to increase interest rates at that point, inflationary pressures might pile up', 'An important corollary is that the start of the tightening cycle should not wait for headline inflation to rise', 'The increase in interest rate, which as I mentioned previously initially entails only a reduction in the degree of monetary expansion rather than an absolute tightening, has to start before inflationary pressures materialise', 'It is aimed at ensuring that inflation does not rise later on, when it is too late and more costly to bring inflation down', 'The sooner interest rates are raised, as economic activity recovers, the less interest rates will have to be increased later on to maintain price stability', 'In implementing this strategy the central bank is faced with the three problems mentioned previously', 'Let me start with the information problem', 'It is very difficult to forecast the beginning of an upswing, giving the uncertainties prevailing around turnarounds', 'According to some, this problem should not be so serious', 'If the central bank has a simple linear-quadratic loss function, uncertainty does not affect the optimality of the policy decision, ex-ante', 'The central bank should thus use its best forecast as a basis for such a decision', '[1]  The experience of the early 1970s confirms that hesitating for too long at the start of a tightening cycle may be quite dangerous', 'Recent research has shown that the Great Inflation of the 1970s may have originated from the combination of an information problem (the difficulty of assessing the level of excess demand in real time[2]) and an incentive problem, due to the fact that a tightening would have been politically costly at times of rising unemployment and slowing output growth, especially in an intellectual environment in which the long-term link between inflation and monetary policy was less than fully clear', '[3]  Some might find it appropriate for the central bank to wait until there is clear evidence that growth has picked up above potential and that the output gap has started to close before starting to tighten', 'The risk of having possibly waited too long and having been behind the curve could be reduced through an acceleration of the pace of tightening thereafter', 'However, as I have indicated in a speech made in Berlin about one year ago, the risk of getting behind the curve (what I then called “Type I” error) might further increase if the tightening starts at an interest rate level that is substantially below the “neutral” level', '[4]  One lesson that might be drawn from the recent tightening cycle is that the lower is the starting point, in terms of interest rate level, the less a central bank can afford to wait to have confirmation of the ongoing recovery before starting to tighten', 'To be sure, even if the central bank might have some room to wait for data confirming the economic pick up, it should certainly not wait for inflation to be on the rise to increase interest rates', 'This would clearly imply falling behind the curve and having to correct more abruptly at a later stage with sharper interest rate increases', 'For the ECB, the monetary pillar of the strategy, which is based on the analysis of money and credit aggregates, proved to be quite a useful complement to motivate the start of the monetary tightening (or I should perhaps say the “normalisation” of monetary conditions) at the end of 2005', 'In addition to the staff projections that were pointing to an inflation rate above the ECB’s definition of price stability over the whole forecasting horizon, the fast rate of growth of monetary and credit aggregates in the course of the second half of 2005 provided an independent confirmation that interest rates were extremely low in comparison to the underlying fundamentals', 'Not taking into account these monetary developments would have entailed a further risk of falling behind the curve, in an environment of very expansionary monetary conditions', 'A further challenge for the central bank is to explain the start of the tightening cycle to financial markets and the public at large', 'Relying on economic forecasts alone might be difficult as the timing and pace of economic recovery are generally subject to wide debate', 'In addition, politicians and social partners tend to ask the usual question: “Why are you increasing interest rates if there is no inflation', '”   The obvious answer to the question is that what matters is not the current inflation rate but the outlook for future price stability', 'However, given the uncertainties surrounding the assessment of the cyclical position, the central bank might want to use a variety of arguments and indicators to explain the reasons underlying the start of the tightening', 'I have found that a useful tool to address the communication challenge is a simple comparison between the prevailing real interest rate level and the rate of growth of real income', 'As I mentioned previously, at the end of 2005 the real interest rate was close to zero in the euro area, while the rate of growth of economic activity was progressively picking up, from a yearly pace of around 1', '5 per cent to 2 per cent', 'Even somebody with a basic economic background would understand that under these conditions keeping interest rates unchanged, at around zero in real terms, would have implied an increase in the degree of monetary expansion, which would have not been compatible over time with price stability', 'The fast pace of monetary and credit aggregates and the dynamics of asset prices confirmed that the prevailing level of interest rate was very low and potentially jeopardising price stability', 'How fast to tighten', 'The second issue I would like to address is the speed of adjustment of policy rates once a tightening process is initiated', 'This will of course depend inter alia on the strength of the recovery, the level of the output gap, the starting position and the distance of the actual interest rate from a plausible measure of its long-term equilibrium level', 'All these considerations will obviously be surrounded by a great deal of uncertainty', 'On the other hand, there is generally a lot of pressure on the central bank for it to be as explicit as possible on the foreseen interest rate path', 'How should central banks react to such a request', 'Should central banks communicate to the market on how quickly they intend to bring the interest rate back to the equilibrium level (assuming that they know what the equilibrium level is)', 'There is an interesting degree of variation in central bank practices around the world', 'Some central banks, notably the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (since 2000) and the Central Bank of Norway (since 2005) have started to provide the public with a quantitative indication of the most likely course of policy as part of their macroeconomic policy projections', 'Other central banks, most notably the Federal Reserve, have provided a qualitative guidance on the likely direction and pace of interest rate moves', 'The ECB has instead refrained from giving guidance to market participants beyond the very short term (one to two months), leaving to the latter the task of setting their own expectations', 'In my view, the idea of giving markets explicit forward guidance has some advantages, but also some drawbacks', 'Let me elaborate', 'There are three possible advantages of giving forward guidance to the markets, beyond the very short term', 'First, and most important, it may enhance the central bank leverage over long-term interest rates and therefore increases the potency of monetary policy', 'This may not be a very important consideration at all times, but it may become quite useful once the central bank faces a significant risk of hitting the zero bound on nominal interest rates and if the private sector is unsure about the likely monetary policy response under such conditions', '[5]  The objective of increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy may be particularly important if the central bank has previously fallen behind the curve and waited too long before increasing interest rates', 'Under these circumstances, preannouncement may help anchoring market expectations and avoid an increase in inflationary expectations', 'However, there is no guarantee that forward guidance will work if used occasionally, as I will explain in a moment', 'A second potential advantage is that forward guidance may provide observers with a better understanding of the central bank reaction function', 'Since the projected interest rate path is (quantitatively or qualitatively) dependent on the projected path of macroeconomic variables, a revelation of the preferred path may give the market more explicit information on how the central bank plans to react to certain (though hypothetical) developments', 'Interestingly enough, however, in Norway and New Zealand market interest rates have generally not always fully aligned to the path projected by the central bank', 'Finally, the necessity of giving the market some forward guidance automatically forces the policy-making bodies to agree on a baseline scenario for the future', 'This may provide a useful internal framework for discussion and favour a more structured and consistent communication policy', 'These are the advantages', 'But there are also drawbacks', 'First, even when they are not intended to be so, there is a certain risk that the projected interest rate path is interpreted by the markets as being as an unconditional commitment', 'This may happen even when the central bank is careful in explaining that deviations of actual rates from the projected path should be seen as the norm, rather than the exception, as is the case of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Central Bank of Norway', 'This is, in essence, a communication challenge', 'The problem is a serious one because the macroeconomic outlook might be subject to sizeable and frequent changes, in particular following the release of new data', '[6] A central bank wishing to communicate in a consistent way the path of future interest rates would need to release a new path almost every month, or even more frequently, if it wants to be effective in its task of guiding markets and to be fully transparent', 'We can observe that the market yield curve can at times change quite significantly in a matter of weeks', 'For instance, the yield curve for the implied expected overnight rate in the euro area shifted down quite a bit between mid-August this year and mid-September', '[7] If a central bank decided to communicate its expected interest rate path to guide the markets, it might have to do so with a very high frequency, at least on occasions', 'That could be quite confusing for market participants', 'The second problem, which has not been sufficiently debated in the literature but is, in my opinion, quite important is that providing forward guidance to markets, at least to the extent to which it is intended to steer longer-term interest rates, may be difficult and costly to implement', 'Forward guidance is effective if it is credible, and in order to be credible, the central bank has to deliver on past promises', 'Due to the unavoidable changes in the underlying economic conditions (here we see again the information problem arising), there may be occasions in which the central bank might have to deviate from its pre-announced path', 'In these cases it might not be clear ex post whether the central bank is reneging on past promises or simply reacting to newly available macroeconomic data in an optimal manner', 'For a central bank that needs to establish its reputation, for instance because it might have started the tightening cycle too late and have fallen behind the curve, there could be an incentive to stick to the pre-announced path rather than trying to explain a deviation from it, even if it is justified', 'Third, and related to my previous point, a successful forward guidance may pre-empt private sector expectations, reducing their information content', 'Rather than incorporating private information, bond prices would simply reflect the views of the central bank', 'Pre-empting private sector expectations of future interest rates would amount to restrict the information set on which policy is based', 'This would make monetary policy less effective, exacerbating the information problem', '[8] While it is difficult to quantify the loss, my sense is that it would not be negligible', 'Finally, the need of agreeing on a full path of future interest rates, and eventually updating it in light of economic developments, might not be that easy, especially in a complex setting such as the Eurosystem where the Governing Council is composed of eighteen (soon nineteen) members', 'This consideration is especially important in a tightening cycle, when – as I mentioned earlier – monetary policy decisions are subject to criticism and political resistance', 'In such an environment, it has been suggested that taking a step at a time might be preferable than agreeing on a grand strategy all at once', '[9] The relevance of this type of problem very much depends on the institutional setting within and surrounding the central bank, which varies from country to country', 'The analytical tools used by central banks are also of some relevance here', 'Deciding on a path for future interest rates is easier if the monetary policy is geared towards a single inflation projection, as in an inflation targeting framework', 'The ECB’s monetary policy strategy explicitly eschews the use of an all-encompassing model and is based on the systematic use of available information under the two pillars of the strategy', 'It is naturally much more difficult for this approach to be embedded in a one-dimensional model which automatically produces a nice chart for the future path of interest rates, conditional to a path for inflation forecasts', 'All in all, it can be questioned that a strategy aimed at providing markets with explicit forward guidance has more advantages than drawbacks', 'The experience of the ECB over the recent tightening cycle, which consists of giving guidance only over the very short term (one to two months) but not pre-committing beyond that horizon and basing rate decisions on underlying and projected economic developments has proved to be quite successful and well received by the markets', 'In terms of market volatility beyond the very short term, there seems to be no majors cost to be paid, as compared to strategies that are more explicit on future interest rate path', '[10] For example, the degree of uncertainty perceived by market participants on the future course of monetary policy, as measured by the implied volatility on Euribor and Eurodollar futures contracts, is of the same order of magnitude in the euro area as in the US', 'Furthermore, sufficient flexibility has been kept to adjust the pace of the tightening to unexpected changes in the underlying economic conditions, moving in particular from a three month to a two months frequency in the 25 basis points increase', 'Also, the possibility has been used by the ECB to signal clearly to the markets when the prevailing expectations did not coincide with its own assessment of the interest rate path, leading to an immediate correction', 'What is really important, in my opinion, to effectively guide financial markets is to communicate very clearly the analytical framework of the central bank and how new information and data are incorporated in the decision making', 'This should enable market participants to derive their own expectation about the future path of interest rates', 'This strategy might be more effective than pre-announcing the pace of the monetary tightening', 'When to stop tightening', 'This is in fact the most difficult question to answer, not only because downturns are difficult to forecast but also because the cost of a policy mistake at that stage is higher and there is less room to make up for it later on', 'Stopping too soon might unleash further inflationary pressures as the economy starts weakening, thus reducing the room for cutting interest rates to accommodate the slowdown', 'Stopping too late might worsen the economic downturn, with the need to reverse rapidly the policy direction, undermining the credibility of the central bank', 'The end of the tightening cycle should ideally anticipate the turn of the cyclical position of the economy', 'If the economy grows above its potential and the output gap becomes positive, keeping inflationary pressures and expectations under control could require that the interest rate is increased above the long term equilibrium level', 'The main difficulty at the peak of the cycle is to calibrate the level of interest rate in such a way as to ensure price stability without affecting negatively economic growth', 'I would like to focus in particular on two variables relevant in this assessment: the growth rate of productivity and inflation expectations', 'Over the cycle, the strengthening of productivity growth temporarily moderates firms’ marginal costs, including labour costs, thus dampening inflationary pressure', 'One might conclude that as long as productivity recovers there is a lesser need to adjust interest rates because inflationary pressures are kept under control', 'This would be a wrong conclusion', 'Rising productivity implies a higher level of the “neutral” interest rate', 'Keeping market rates unchanged while the “neutral” rate rises implies, as we have seen previously, an expansion of monetary conditions that will ultimately lead to higher inflation', 'To avoid this effect interest rates have to be adjusted upwards, in line with the increase in the “neutral” rate', 'Hence, stronger productivity growth might result in higher, not lower nor constant, interest rates', 'Put differently, increasing productivity growth has a dampening effect on inflationary pressure only to the extent that the interest rate is adjusted to take into account the increase in the “neutral” level', '[11]  The reasoning is quite similar to that used in the through of the cycle to assess the appropriateness of the interest rate level against nominal income growth, using a simple monetary framework', 'As the economic recovery strengthens, and the negative output gap is reduced or even tends to become positive, the level of the interest rate needs to be adjusted to avoid monetary conditions becoming excessively expansionary', 'The analysis has to consider both the price and real component of nominal income', 'For instance, if inflation slows down, due to a fall in oil prices, but disposable income strengthens following the improvement in the terms of trade, the pace of nominal income growth could remain unchanged', 'This implies that the interest rate path should not be affected by the fall in inflation, especially if temporary', 'This point is not easily appreciated by market participants and observers, and thus implies some communication effort by central banks', 'Another indicator that might be useful in guiding a central bank in the decision of when to stop tightening is agents’ inflationary expectations', 'These indicators have to be used with some caution', 'In particular, evidence of stable long-term inflation expectations, consistent with price stability, do not necessarily imply that the monetary policy tightening can be stopped', 'There are at least two reasons for this', 'First, the analysis of data on inflation expectations is not straightforward since financial market indicators (such as break even inflation extracted from inflation-linked bond yields) tends to differ from, and be more reactive than expectations drawn from survey data', 'In the US, for example, inflation expectations derived from bond yields fluctuated significantly over recent years, while survey-based measures (such as those of the Philadelphia Fed Survey) have barely moved at all', 'It is therefore not obvious which measure is most reliable', 'Second, and most important, long term inflation expectations might remain low or even fall at the peak of the cycle, but might rise again if headline inflation does not rapidly fall in parallel with the slowdown of the economy', 'If this happens, it is then difficult (and costly for the real economy) to bring expectations back to levels consistent with price stability', 'It might require keeping rates at a significantly high level for some time', 'Indeed, experience suggests that expectations have some intrinsic inertia and cannot be easily reversed', 'It is therefore better to prevent an “inflation scare\" from happening, and not be forced to react to it ex post', 'All in all, it is important to monitor inflation expectations, but a central bank should not wait until they move substantially before adjusting rates', 'Otherwise it may be too late and further tightening might be needed to bring inflation expectations back to equilibrium', '[12]  In practice, therefore, there is no reason to think that the monetary policy tightening should necessarily stop at some long-term average level of interest rate (or any other empirical measure of the natural interest rate)', 'This will depend inter alia on the position of the economy in the cycle, compared to its potential (output gap) and the persistence of inflationary pressures', 'It is then not surprising that deciding the end of the tightening cycle is as difficult as the start, if not more', 'The information problem is typically different at this stage, but no less challenging', 'In addition to the uncertainty on the timing of the cyclical peak and the sustainability of the recovery, there is an even greater one on whether the interest rate is at a level which may be deemed compatible with the maintainance of price stability', 'This is why the concept of “neutral” and long term equilibrium interest rates, while appealing in theory, are very difficult to use in practice for the implementation of monetary policy', 'The uncertainty surrounding the calculation of the “neutral” level of interest rate, in particular at the peak of the cycle, makes this concept very difficult to be made operational', 'There is by now a large body of literature on the real-time uncertainty surrounding the neutral and natural level of interest rates', '[13] Some authors have suggested that central banks should concentrate on the changes in interest rates and forget about the level altogether, given the measurement problems', '[14] It is certainly true that assessing the key components of the equilibrium real interest rate, in particular productivity growth, is not easy and can lead to persistent policy errors, even if the central bank behaves optimally', '[15] In the euro area and in other countries, we have seen persistent forecast errors in growth and inflation, but to date we cannot be sure that such forecast errors derive from problems in measuring potential output growth or from the effects of temporary shocks', 'In practice, the end of the tightening cycle will have to remain dependent on the assessment of the underlying and projected economic conditions', 'These conditions are subject to change, following temporary or more permanent factors', 'It is thus very difficult to preannounce a given interest rate level or a given policy attitude to be followed around the peak of the cycle', 'The main guiding factor for interest rate adjustment has to remain the pursue of price stability over the relevant horizon for monetary policy and the anchoring of inflationary expectations', 'Conclusions    Let me conclude by trying to put forward some general lessons that might be learned from the recent experience, which is clearly incomplete', 'These few comments are obviously non exhaustive and very schematic', 'They are presented in a synthetic way and should be considered as input for further discussion and reflection rather than providing any insight on future policy actions', \"To start tightening:    Don't wait too long, especially if the signs of recovery are apparent and interest rates are at very low levels\", 'The sooner tightening start, the less tightening might be needed later on', 'To be sure, don’t wait to see inflation rising before raising rates', 'It will be too late', 'Use a wide set of indicators and arguments to explain to market participants and the public at large why tightening is needed', 'Money and credit aggregates, asset prices and the level of interest rates might be useful indicators of why the time has come to reduce accommodation', 'While tightening:    If the strength of the recovery is uncertain, don’t feel compelled to commit to a given path, even if the markets ask for it', 'Keep enough flexibility to be able to accelerate or slow down the tightening, depending on underlying economic conditions without appearing to change the underlying strategy', 'Use the same set of indicators mentioned above to explain why the pace of tightening needs to be adapted', 'At the end of the tightening:    Don’t preannounce when (and at what interest rate level) the tightening will be over, but rather that it will depend on the development of the underlying fundamentals', 'Be aware that if the tightening is ended too soon, interest rates might have to remain at a high level for some time, even as the economy slows down', 'Monitor inflation expectations carefully, but do not wait until they rise before increasing interest rates', 'All in all, independently of the state of the tightening cycle, it is always important that market participants and the public at large have a clear understanding of the overall strategy that underlies monetary policy and of the analytical framework that leads to policy decisions', 'They should also understand the uncertainties underlying economic developments throughout the cycle, that complicate the decision making process', 'Agents should ideally be able to forecast the policy action of the central bank on the basis of the flow of information that they receive and of their understanding of the central bank strategy', 'These are the foundation of a predictable and

saw a cumulative reduction in the policy rate of 275 basis points in the euro area, accomplished in a sequence of seven moves', 'The ECB started to reverse that cycle in December last year and has since changed its policy in a sequence of three steps', 'In the United States, the same easing phase saw 13 reductions, with a total loosening of 550 basis points, and was first reversed in June 2004', 'Since then, the Federal Reserve has hiked its target rate 16 times in continuous steps', 'I thought I would take advantage of the opportunity afforded by this impressive programme to revisit a theme on which I have reflected in the past: “activism” in monetary policy', 'Is there a univocal definition of this notion', 'Can “activism” be quantified by simple statistics such as the frequency and size of policy moves', 'Can a central bank be “active” while moving its policy rate in a measured and observationally cautious way', 'Was the ECB active enough in responding to the evolving state of the euro area economy', 'The few facts that I have recounted seem to suggest otherwise', 'I will try to convince you that the contrary is true', 'I will offer some provisional answers on the basis of what I believe I have learned thus far', 'I suspect, though, that the passing of time and further analysis of the euro area economy will be needed to deepen our understanding of this issue', 'My definition of activism in monetary policy is, I believe, conventional: activism is the strategic attitude of a central bank that is constantly endeavouring to be faithful to its objective', 'In the case of the ECB, it is the constant striving to keep inflation close to its arithmetic objective, and to take all the steps needed to check nascent inflationary pressures while at the same time trying to minimise unnecessary macroeconomic disruptions in the process', '“Activist” is an attribute that applies to a strategy, not to a policy path', 'My answer to the question of whether or not activism can be measured by simple statistics is negative', 'Strategic activism in monetary policy cannot be quantified in simple terms, not in abstraction from knowledge of the key structural forces and economic relationships that govern the functioning of our systems at any point in time', 'When evaluating the appropriateness of their action, central banks do not have the luxury of linking policy to a handful of summary statistics', 'They engage in a complicated process of signal extraction from a wealth of diffuse data and events', 'They calibrate decisions to the key structural parameters of the economy in which monetary policy has to function, to the nature of the shocks to which the economy is typically prone', 'The path of policy is adjusted accordingly', 'The ECB’s strategy is as active as it needs to be to fulfil our mandate', 'I would claim that clarity about the objective of our policy afforded considerable latitude for action in the early years of the decade, and a remarkable leverage over market conditions more recently', 'This has happened despite repeated unfavourable shocks in the former period and apparent policy inaction in the latter', 'Always, our strategy and the information coming from the real economy, as well as from the sphere of monetary aggregates, much more than our words, have shaped market expectations beyond the very near term, a sign that the complex analysis required to predict our judgement has not materially impeded market participants in responding meaningfully to incoming data', 'Policy activism and economic dynamism    To frame the issue, let us consider a stereotypical monetary policy reaction function that has a short-term interest rate on the left and a number of observable reaction variables on the right', 'Think, for example, of any kind of reaction functions that econometricians and expert observers often use – and sometimes abuse – to compare monetary policy strategies', 'In essence, they all encapsulate a simple rule of thumb: raise the policy rate if anticipated inflation is higher than the objective and there are signs that the economy is operating above capacity', 'An additional condition for ensuring macroeconomic stability that applies to these rules is that the reaction in the nominal rate must be strong enough for the real rate to be varied pro-cyclically: when inflation expectations rise, and the economy expands above potential, real monetary conditions have to be tightened', 'I choose this way of framing the issue primarily because it is widely used by our observers, and because it is sufficiently concise to be easily understood', 'But, before launching into the analysis, I should add that, precisely because it is simple and pedagogical, this framework is also a very incomplete description of our policy behaviour', 'Overall, because it does not capture the very essence of the two-pillar strategy, based on an economic assessment of medium-term risks to price stability, on the one hand, and a cross-checking based on medium to longer-term risks assessed though our monetary analysis, on the other', 'Also, because such representations of our policy are not sufficiently state-contingent, whereas my colleagues and I are far from being exclusively guided by mechanical configurations of indicators, but are very interested in the contingencies, and finally take our decisions on the basis of synthetic judgement enlightened by multiple experiences', 'As I often say, collegial wisdom is of the essence in central banking', 'This underscores the tension between describing policy simply and implementing policy simply: simple descriptions of policy need not – and indeed never do – mean simple policy behaviour', 'Assuming that the parameters attached to the various indicator variables in the reaction function indeed capture the deep strategic preferences of the central bank, empirical estimates of these coefficients are often used to quantify the strength with which the central bank intends to respond to the state of the economy', 'In other words, these estimated parameters are sometimes viewed as objective measures of strategic “activism” in monetary policy', 'A central bank would qualify as strategically more passive – or less active – than another central bank if the estimated coefficient attached to inflation expectations in deviation from the central bank’s objective, and the estimated coefficient penalising the indicator of macroeconomic slack, turned out to be smaller', 'Why would this central bank qualify as more “passive”', 'Because, for given variances of inflation and real activity, this central bank would indeed be inclined to take more moderate action in response to changes in the outlook', 'It would move its policy rate by narrower margins – and perhaps more infrequently – than its more “activist” counterpart', 'Moreover, as analysts typically append a partial adjustment mechanism to the representation of how the central bank interest rate responds to the economic state, there is an additional source of “activism” – or “passivity” – that would emerge from these simple empirics', 'This is the inertia coefficient attached to the lagged interest rate dependent variable, which in these rules moderates the pace of reaction of the policy rate to its fundamental determinants', 'In any case, in the naive theory of this world, plain comparison of the frequencies of policy moves and the size of interest rate adjustments would suffice to tell the strategies of these two central banks apart', 'A smoother policy path would signal a “more passive” strategy', 'But of course the world is not that simple, and in fact there are serious pitfalls lurking behind strategic inferences drawn on the basis of comparisons of variances in policy rates', 'It is not too difficult to portray situations in which such inferences could be highly misleading', 'I will give three examples, all relaxing one important qualification upon which my earlier example was predicated: the assumption that our two central banks are confronted with the same economic environment', 'First, imagine two central banks which are equally responsive to economic conditions: in the reaction-rule jargon that I am using here, these are two central banks that share exactly the same reaction parameters', 'But one central bank now faces a less dynamic economy than its counterpart', 'By “less dynamic” I mean an economy that – as a matter of regularity – is hit by shocks of smaller magnitude which tend to fade away more gradually', 'Here, reaction parameters are the same – by hypothesis – but the reaction variables fluctuate at different speeds', 'All other things being equal, the patterns of adjustment of the policy rate that the same rule would induce in the two economies would be likely to look very different', 'The central bank operating in the less dynamic economy would in all likelihood be observed to adjust interest rates along a more moderate path', 'The other central bank would appear more reactive', 'But any strategic implications drawn from the variance in the two policy paths would be purely illusionary', 'The smoother course of policy would not reveal any deep-seated strategic inertia: it would only reflect the same response to shocks with quite different dynamic properties', 'Monetary policy would appear “passive” because the economy itself was evolving slowly', '[1]  A second example again considers two identical central banks, now facing shocks of a different nature', 'One central bank predominantly faces demand shocks, which result in persistent departures from trend growth', 'This statistical pattern has symmetric and durable effects on output and inflation and thus presents a relatively straightforward monetary policy problem under the rule that I am postulating here for simplicity', 'As both reaction variables – forecasted inflation and output – would frequently move in tandem, the policy rate of this central bank would have to be changed frequently and forcefully in the same direction to offset the shock', 'But what would happen in the other economy, if it – unlike the first – were more prone to supply shocks', 'Experience suggests that supply shocks yield sharp transitory increases in inflation, possibly followed by smaller, more permanent “second-round” effects, though the longer-run impact on inflation is obviously significantly determined by the response of monetary policy', 'Given the transitory nature of the initial inflation bursts, the simple hypothetical rule – which incorporates the reaction to expected inflation – would advise the central bank to “look through” the immediate disturbance and change policy only to the extent needed to offset the anticipated more permanent effects of the shock on inflation in subsequent quarters', 'Its policy rate, again, would be observed to be less variable', 'What is important to note is that the same rule – equally active strategies – would support two different patterns of observed policy behaviour in different economic environments', 'The third case is perhaps the most interesting of all', 'Here exogenous shocks are identical, but economic structures differ', 'Different transmission mechanisms therefore propagate the same shocks with lags that vary between the two economies', 'The first economy has more rigid adjustment mechanisms: price-setters and wage-negotiators are more sluggish than those in the other economy in processing economic news – including changes in the stance of monetary policy – and bringing them to bear on their decisions', 'What is the source of those rigidities in the first economy', 'There can be many reasons for rigidity', 'Perhaps labour practices and contractual institutions – dating from the early post-war decades when the economy was heavily regulated – induce distortions in large segments of the labour market', 'This stands in the way of an efficient matching of skills and productive capabilities', 'Perhaps tight regulatory restraint on business and statutory inhibitions discourage innovation and impede a faster response to new shocks and new opportunities', 'Whatever the source of rigidity, the observational result is that prices and wages in the first economy reflect changes in fundamentals with considerable lags', 'How should monetary policy respond to shocks in these conditions', 'Note that I am moving away from the naive world of simple policy rules and am taking a step further into the – admittedly no less conjectural – realm of optimal policy design', 'The answer to my question depends critically on the inflation process that we postulate', 'We know that when inflation expectations are well-anchored around the inflation objective of the central bank, the evolution of inflation over time is influenced by the numerical objective of policy more than by the history of inflation itself', 'We can state this differently, saying that when the economy internalises the central bank’s objective firmly, the inflation process becomes less persistent and more forward-looking', 'If inflation expectations are well-anchored, a shock to inflation in the recent past is likely to have a lesser impact on inflation in the future', 'One reason for this is that the shock will not encourage workers to bargain for commensurate rises in nominal wages to protect the real value of earnings', 'Equally, firms would certainly resist such potential bargaining', 'All such parties and other price-setters will anticipate that the central bank will ultimately drive inflation back to its pre-shock level', 'Hence, they will tend to treat past inflationary shocks as transitory and inconsequential for the future outlook', 'In the first economy in this example, where prices are sticky and inflation expectations are well-anchored, monetary policy can be more patient and focused on the medium term when confronting a cost-push shock', 'Again, as in the other two examples, it is likely to be observed to change policy less aggressively in the face of an unexpected shock to headline inflation', 'But this seeming “patience”, once again, does not signal inertia, “passivity” or neglect for macroeconomic conditions', 'It reflects a careful calibration of the policy course to the structural peculiarities of the underlying economy', 'First and foremost, the policy response to the inflationary shock will be less persistent because the inflationary consequences of the shock will be more promptly reabsorbed in the first place', 'Second, with stickier prices, a change in the nominal policy rate of a given size will have a stronger impact on the real rate, which is all that matters when it comes to measuring the stance of policy', 'In these conditions, a more moderate policy path is not a cause of instability', 'In fact, it is the very precondition for avoiding the dangers of over-steering, of accidentally destabilising the economy', 'Of course, the thought experiments that I have been sharing with you so far are only as useful as the rules or the optimality benchmarks with which real-world behaviour has been compared', 'And I am certainly not the only one here who believes that simple reaction rules – or monetary policy optimality exercises, for that matter – cannot serve as the ultimate test for actual policy behaviour', 'But I hope I have conveyed one notion', 'Even in the over-simplified world of my canonical examples, where the macroeconomic state can be adequately described by a handful of facts, where these facts are reliably condensed in summary indicators – which, too, are immune from sampling errors and statistical revisions[2] – and where policy algorithms are an acceptable description of policy choices, even in that conjectural world the variability of the policy instrument would not be a sufficient statistic with which to judge monetary policy strategies', 'In particular, even in that world, a slower-moving, structurally more rigid economy would support an observationally more moderate policy course', 'In the real world, as I will try to explain next, that observationally moderate path for policy receives an even stronger justification', 'Facts and policy in the euro area    My emphasis on a structurally more rigid and less dynamic economy periodically facing adverse supply shocks is, of course, deliberate', 'That laboratory case resembles the euro area that I know', 'I will organise my interpretation of stylised facts about the euro area in the recent past into three broad categories: shocks, structures and monetary policy', 'Shocks    One reason the euro area resembles my third example is that, compared with the United States, it seems to be subject to demand shocks of smaller magnitude but to be more frequently hit by supply shocks', '[3] In the last ten years this shock pattern seems to have grown even more pronounced, despite globalisation and a generalised shift towards closer international economic integration', '[4] This is nowhere more evident than in the anatomy of the boom-bust cycle that spanned the decade starting in 1995 in the two economies', 'In the United States, the run-up phase was significantly propelled – as we know with hindsight – by overly optimistic views about long-run earnings growth and, notably, exaggerated beliefs in the profitability of emerging technologies', 'But the strength in business investment that the boom brought with it also had important implications for the supply side of the US economy, through its influence on the rate of increase in labour productivity and thus the economy’s sustainable level of potential output', 'ECB staff calculations estimate that the contribution to the growth of output per hour worked coming from capital deepening doubled in the United States in the course of the 1990s', 'Subsequently – and despite the sharp reappraisal of those expectations and the unprecedented drop in business investment that followed the market collapse in 2000 – it stabilised at the elevated levels that it had reached at the turn of the millennium', 'Since then, remarkably, capital deepening has been replaced, as the main engine of output per hour growth, by extraordinary advancements in total factor productivity (TFP)', 'Arguably, US firms have been able to meet expanding demand with a more efficient organisation of the production processes', 'The same ten-year episode had a distinctly different face in the euro area', 'The stock market appreciation – comparable in size to that seen in the United States – went hand in hand with a decline, not a rise, in the contribution of capital to measured productivity', 'And a contemporaneous steady decline in TFP throughout the decade has reinforced, rather than offset, the diminishing contribution of capital', '[5] The euro area seems to have had its fair share of stock market turbulence, without enjoying the side benefit of improved supply conditions', 'The slowdown in trend productivity has been a primary determinant of the weak economic performance of the euro area', 'By depressing income growth prospects and by reducing the prospective return on capital, it has held back consumption spending and business investment, which has been further curtailed to some extent by the ongoing demographic shift towards a more elderly population', '[6] Rapidly decelerating productivity was one force behind the counter-cyclical rebound in unit labour costs that we observed during the early part of the new millennium', '[See Figure 2]', 'This surge in unit labour costs was atypical, if contrasted with the way in which unit labour costs in the United States elastically responded to the downturn with a sharp decline, and it represented an ongoing source of inflationary pressures', 'Adverse underlying developments in productivity have made it more difficult for our firms to smooth through the volatility of the many non-wage cost disturbances that they have encountered since 1999', 'This lesser degree of resilience has kept the evolution of inflation – and real activity as well – constantly vulnerable to unexpected shocks, such as the increases in the prices of energy and beef – to name only two – which have been brought about by adverse changes in supply conditions', '[7] Note that inflation [Figure 3] edged higher in the downturn phase and remained at elevated levels thereafter, at a time when the accumulating margin of slack in labour and product markets could in fact have been expected to reduce price pressures', 'Again, compare these developments with the sharp disinflation which occurred, during the same period, in the United States', 'Of course, we cannot directly observe full capacity of either labour or other production factors', 'Consequently, we can never be certain about the level of activity that would represent the full utilisation of available resources, and even less so about the strength of the relationship that links utilisation and inflation', 'However, I hope that I have demonstrated that this connection is seemingly weak in the euro area, probably weaker than across the Atlantic', 'Structures    This structural feature brings me to the second category of my remarks: the structure of the economy on this side of the Atlantic', 'I will concentrate on two factors that critically affect the relationship between inflation and the fundamental shocks that drive the economy and determine its state: price flexibility and the anchoring of price-setting', 'Extensive empirical research on price flexibility and inflation persistence in the euro area has recently been produced in a concerted effort that has occupied staff of the ECB and of the entire European System of Central Banks', '[8] It comes to two main conclusions', 'First, in the euro area, prices are distinctly less flexible than, say, in the United States', 'Prices change infrequently: the average duration of a consumer price spell – a measure of the time that it takes for retailers to reprice their products – is 13 months [Table 1]', 'According to surveys, it is 11 months for producers', 'In the United States, comparable figures indicate durations of less than 7 months and slightly more than 8 months respectively', '[9]    Table 1: Measures of price stickiness for the euro area and the United States        Sources: For the CPI in the euro area, Dhyne et al', '(2005), Bils and Klenow (2004) in the US', 'For the PPI, Vermeulen et al', '(2005)', 'Surveys: Fabiani et al', '(2005) for the euro area, Blinder et al', '(1998) for the US', 'New Keynesian Phillips Curve: Estimates in Galí et al', '(2001, 2003) refer to the GDP deflator and are converted from original quarterly figures', 'More infrequent price revisions make the setting of prices less responsive to economic news, including, as I already pointed out, changes in monetary conditions', 'In general, sticky price revision processes reduce the odds that the imbalances created by economic shocks can be rectified by adjustments in prices', 'Conversely, they make the burden of adjustment to a shock fall disproportionately on changes in output, incomes and employment', 'Also, stickier prices tend – all other things being equal – to increase the persistence of inflation', 'This is because the impact of a shock that today modifies firms’ real cost conditions tends to be spread out over an extended future, as staggered price adjustments catch up only slowly with the changed underlying circumstances', 'Despite sluggish price-setting mechanisms, however, inflation persistence in the euro area is low by international standards', 'This is the second important finding of the new body of evidence that I mentioned: an inflationary shock dissipates quickly in the euro area despite rigidities, and inflation has a tendency to return to its long-run norm reasonably quickly', 'The half-life of the effect of a shock to inflation is considerably less than one year, which is close to the figure that one obtains, for example, for the United States, again notwithstanding vastly different patterns of price-updating practices across the two areas', 'What explains this apparently inconsistent evidence', 'Another ECB study, estimating a structural model on euro area and US data, goes some way towards reconciling empirical stickiness in prices and low persistence in inflation on the basis of a model of inflation determination that features real costs and expectations', '[10] As I said before, even if price sluggishness introduces persistence into the inflation process – which in itself tends to perpetuate past inflation pressures into the future – some of that persistence can be undone if the expectations of price and wage-setters are focused on the objective of the central bank', 'Indeed, this study finds that the influence of the ECB’s inflation objective on the evolution over time of inflation outweighs the influence of past shocks, and thus at least partly compensates for the added inertia resulting from a more rigid economic structure', 'We are pleased to observe that analysis of survey-based measures of inflation expectations suggests that central bank leverage on expectations has become much stronger since the establishment of the euro', '[11]       Monetary policy    Having reviewed structures and shocks, I now move on to the third aspect of my discussion of the euro area: monetary policy', 'Did considerations pertaining to the nature of the shocks that occurred in the recent past and to the structural peculiarities of the euro area play any role in positioning the stance of monetary policy', 'Can they go some way towards explaining the observationally moderate path that the policy rate has followed in the euro area', 'Did the smoother path of our policy rate impede a smooth adjustment of the euro area to the shocks that have hit the global economy in the recent past', 'Finally, does low inflation persistence provide reason for complacency', 'When the ECB in early 2001 initiated the easing cycle that we started to reverse in December last year, this was done on the heels of significant adverse supply shocks, relatively strong wage dynamics, and headline inflation rates at levels unseen in Europe since the late phases of convergence to the new currency', 'Yet the Governing Council judged that our commitment to attaining price stability, in line with our official definition, through our monetary policy strategy was sufficiently credible for us to take that easing decision without running the risk of destabilising inflation expectations', 'That conviction was reinforced by a rapidly deteriorating outlook and by reassuring signs that inflation expectations discounted a scenario in which inflation would settle in the zone of price stability in the medium term', 'The rapid softening of activity that we saw coming and the increasing odds that the recovery would not materialise soon – we believed – would validate ex post the inflation expectations and make the threat of renewed inflation considerably weaker', 'Information extracted from monetary trends supported our prediction of subdued inflation looking into the more distant future', 'Monetary accommodation was quicker and, in retrospect, far more persistent than could have been predicted on the basis of the policy regularities on record', 'In the end, monetary action amounted to an interest rate reduction of 275 basis points, bringing the policy rate to a level which was below the lowest intervention rate of the central banks of an overwhelming majority of member countries, including Germany, during the last 50 years', 'It is all the more remarkable that we were able to follow such a historically unseen trajectory for our vast continental economy, the euro area, given that the individual countries had very diverse and mixed legacies as regards past monetary credibility', 'It is difficult to work out a convincing counterfactual: what would have happened if the reaction of the ECB had been more in line with the patterns of policy behaviour established in the past, rather than the more forceful action we took', 'However, structural – if model-specific – analysis of the mix of the macroeconomic shocks that have hit the euro area since 2001 reveals with hindsight that the extra monetary policy stimulus that we introduced has been critical in avoiding a deeper and more enduring recession here and on a global scale', 'I judge that the policy course was carefully calibrated to the structural characteristics of the euro area transmission mechanism, some features of which I tried to outline earlier', 'We were guided, in particular, by the understanding that a central bank operating in a relatively rigid economy is able to deliver the same quantum of monetary accommodation by adjusting its policy instrument in more moderate steps than in a relatively more flexible economy', 'Under the structural conditions that prevail in our economy, a more aggressive easing would have introduced unwelcome volatility in both inflation and output that would have necessitated corrective, countervailing action further down the road', '[12] Certainly, as I will argue shortly, the ECB would not have maintained the nominal and real policy rate at the low levels at which they were held for more than two years without consistent signs that expectations were well-anchored and inflationary shocks were being quickly reabsorbed', 'Alertness and active communication    No central bank represented in this room, or elsewhere, can reasonably spell out in advance its reaction to every conceivable contingency', 'This means that surprises in our behaviour can never be ruled out, notably in the face of potent shocks', 'In particular, we might be confronted with new occurrences of risks which could force us to take bold steps that our observers could not have predicted by extrapolating from our past history of policy conduct', 'To some extent, this is what occurred over the earlier phase of the international economic downturn: we took sizeable risks in the direction of “activism”', 'What were those risks', 'First, in an economy as rigid as the euro area, it might well be true that temporary imbalances between demand and potential supply are slow to show through convincingly to inflation', 'But if and when they finally do, they would be more costly to correct', '[13] So, monetary policy should be sufficiently alert to any threats to the outlook for price stability, so that it does not find itself reacting belatedly – and with less chance of success – to trends that have long been underway', 'Second, it is true that the expectation that inflation will not come loose from its anchor affords some short-term flexibility to respond to economic disturbances – with a view to ensuring more balanced macroeconomic conditions in the longer term', 'But that flexibility only lasts as long as economic agents and the public are confident that the opportunity will not be misused', 'And we just do not know enough about the way policy actions influence expectations and how sensitive central banks’ credibility is to short-run departures from low inflation to warrant experimenting', 'Occasional monetary policy activism, as circumstances require, is not the same as fine-tuning', 'Fine-tuning – if I may twist a phrase borrowed from Alan Blinder and Ricardo Reis – cannot be resurrected', '[14] Building and maintaining a reputation for prudent policy involves commitment to a systematic strategy: that is, following a recurrent pattern of behaviour, so that stable expectations are consistently validated ex post', 'During the extended period of policy accommodation, we were able to steer expectations effectively without explicit action, proof that markets accept as true the ultimate motives of policy that we profess', 'In those instances in which expectations displayed signs of overreaction to current events – such as surging oil prices – our renewed emphasis in communication on our objective, on the vigilance and determination that we would apply to enforce it, on our steady alertness, provided effective resistance to inordinate developments', 'Importantly, signalling vigilance proved instrumental in reaching a common understanding with the markets: the ECB, though observationally inactive, was at any time ready to start action', 'Our policy course was rightly seen as always contingent on the arrival of new information', 'Given the information available each time the Governing Council meets, the standing assumption in the markets should always be that the policy decision is aimed at positioning the stance of policy appropriately', 'No history of past monetary policy decisions could ever be taken as an indication of a commitment, on our side, to enact a sequence of interest rate moves in the future', 'Unconditional – or “quasi-unconditional” – talk about future policy would have impaired the difficult balance that we maintained between supportive credit conditions and persistently anchored inflation expectations', 'Active emphasis in communication upon “alertness” required keeping all options open to a – possibly quick – change in policy', 'Pre-commitment to a policy path would certainly have made that reversal of policy difficult to execute and/or to justify, and therefore non-credible', 'The markets seem to have internalised these strategic principles with an increasing degree of precision', 'Incoming data which, since the autumn of 2005, have indicated more persuasive signs of a recovery in an environment of abundant liquidity and elevated commodity prices were correctly mapped into expectations that the stance then prevailing would not be consistent with controlling inflation over the medium term', 'Markets anticipated in good time that the ECB would soon begin reversing the extra easing that had been put in place', 'In retrospect, market expectations have aligned well with our intentions', 'Since December, consistent with our remit to be alert and pre-emptive, the monetary policy of the ECB has been perceived to be in a mode of progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation', 'Indeed, this withdrawal has been and remains conditional on the evolution of our analysis with respect to our objective of price stability, but it has not been predicated on any single short-term indicator of the macroeconomic state', 'In the last few months, the ECB has not measured the state of the economy by the strength or weakness of any particular piece of incoming news', 'It has continued to extract the macroeconomic trend from the wealth of cumulative evidence accruing – from month to month – from the economic and the monetary side', 'In both cases, the medium-term orientation of its monitoring activity has been preserved', 'Two examples: as regards our economic analysis, when looking at the underlying trend of growth of the European economy, we judged in the second half of last year that we were experiencing a recovery with the trend progressively approaching potential', 'We judged that the short-term volatility observed in important indicators, including the quarterly growth figure for the fourth quarter of 2005, did not call into question the medium-term growth prospects and therefore the associated gradual increase of risks to price stability', 'Another example can be extracted from our monetary analysis: consistent indications that broad money growth was increasingly due to its most liquid components has contributed in recent months to a gradual tilt of the balance of risks perceived to be signalled by our monetary analysis', 'It was not the behaviour of aggregate M3 per se which altered the outlook for price stability', 'It was the realisation that the structural force at work behind persistently abundant liquidity was becoming increasingly connected with final spending and pricing decisions', 'As I said at the start, the complexity of the analysis required to predict our moves has not materially impeded market participants in responding meaningfully to incoming data', 'The understanding of our strategy and the information coming from the real economy, as well as from the sphere of monetary aggregates, have shaped market expectations beyond the very near term', 'I attribute this satisfactory result to our policy framework, which features a primary, sharply-defined objective and a systematic reaction to events whenever the objective is perceived to be at risk', 'Concluding remarks    I am sometimes asked the following question: “You are in the process of increasing rates', 'Is your judgement that your rates today are significantly lower than they should be', 'What then is the level of the “neutral rate” that you would judge it appropriate to reach (as rapidly as possible)', '” My response to such questions would be the following', 'First, we are not in a position that we would judge “abnormal”, in the sense that we would have to increase as rapidly as possible our interest rates up to the “normal” level', 'We are in a process of progressively withdrawing the present degree of monetary accommodation commensurate with the risks to price stability that we perceive, associated in particular with the present development of the economic recovery', 'To the extent that we never previously pre-committed to unconditional moves and we have always adhered to the posture of steady alertness which is at the heart of our strategy, our monetary policy stance should and does – to the best of our own comprehensive, deep and candid assessment of the situation – at any time makes it possible to cope with the risks we see for price stability in a medium-term perspective', 'Then, in a dynamic perspective, our refusal of unconditional pre-commitments, our position of permanent, steady alertness and our strategy help focus our policy upon being permanently at the “correct level” in terms of attaining our primary goal in a medium-term perspective', 'Second, from a central bank’s perspective, the Wicksellian concept of a “neutral rate” is more particularly useful in the event that the central bank has – for whatever reason – moved its rates far away from the policy stance that it would judge appropriate ici et maintenant, here and now', 'As you can see, in my view, this cannot be the case for the Governing Council of the ECB', 'Third, one can be sure that we will continue to analyse the situation very carefully on an ongoing basis', 'It is clear that if our main scenario is confirmed over time, a further withdrawal of monetary accommodation will be appropriate', 'We do not specify ex ante a sequence of policy actions, as I have said clearly since last December', 'The appropriate policy stance will always depend on information on the economic and monetary side and on the source and dynamic properties of the underlying shocks that will hit the economy and we will always remain alert', 'It is the combination of events and data, some expected, others unexpected, that will be analysed and will permit us to define our future trajectory', 'Thank you for your attention', '[1]  A similar interpretation of “interest rate inertia” – the tendency of central banks to adjust rates in the same direction and in small steps – can be found in G', 'Rudebusch, “Term structure evidence on interest rate smoothing and monetary policy inertia”, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol', '49 (pp', '1161-1187), 2002', '[2]  Of course, in the actual practice of monetary policy, uncertainty about the data is extremely pervasive', 'We are even uncertain about the current economic situation as economic data are received with a lag, are typically subject to multiple revisions, and in any case can only roughly and partially depict the underlying economic reality', '[3]  See, for example, the

correlation coefficient close to 1', 'However, since the cash changeover, the correlation between the two series has dropped to 0', '4', '[12] Counterfactual simulations based on a large-scale estimated dynamic general equilibrium model of the euro area have quantified the implications of alternative policy scenarios', 'This analysis reaches two conclusions', 'First, the loss in GDP that would have been associated with a situation in which the ECB did not deviate from the estimated reaction rule embedded in the model – and thus monetary policy in the euro area followed a tighter course – would have come close to 1% per annum on average since 2001', 'Second, had the ECB followed a more aggressive policy easing, one resembling the sharp rate reduction engineered by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the standard deviation of inflation would have tripled and the standard deviation of output doubled since 2001', 'The model used is documented in Christiano et al cited above', '[13] Another way to state this notion is that in an economy such as the euro area, where prices and wages are as rigid as they prove to be, the “sacrifice ratio” is probably large', 'This means that the action required to counter inflation – when inflationary pressures actually emerge – would be more forceful', '[14] See A', 'Blinder and R', 'Reis, “Understanding the Greenspan

steady growth path, with the number of card transactions in the European Union having almost quadrupled in the last 15 years', 'In France, card usage is well above the EU average', 'Areas with an even stronger card usage (and, correspondingly, a lower share of cash payments) are the Nordic countries, the Netherlands and Great Britain', 'In those countries, a preference for cards over cash is often highly visible in shops, with merchants often actively encouraging card usage by means of signs or other communication', 'While cards are the predominant electronic payment instrument, it should be noted that cards – like cash – were initially designed for face-to-face payment situations', 'Given the strong growth in e-commerce, the necessity of finding appropriate and innovative solutions for new payment situations, i', 'e', 'internet or mobile payments, has become apparent', 'The incidence of fraud related to purchases made over the internet, which involve “card-not-present” (CNP) transactions, has been a source of concern and needs to be addressed by appropriate security measures – I will discuss this in more detail later', 'In general, innovative payment solutions, regardless of whether they are based on cards or other payment instruments, will have an impact on payment behaviour and the usage of cards and other traditional payment instruments in the years to come', 'Nevertheless, there is no doubt that card payments are here to stay', 'I still see a strong growth potential for card transactions, in particular in those countries in central and south-eastern Europe where people largely rely on cash', 'Yet, even a “card-minded” country such as France can realise further efficiency gains in the area of retail payments by increasing its number of card payments', 'Migration to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) for credit transfers and direct debits was a major milestone in European retail payments integration', 'SEPA for cards is the next logical step in that process', 'To this day, consumers and merchants, but also banks and other payment service providers, still encounter obstacles or experience geographical differences when making and accepting card payments', 'We are not yet there with the SEPA for cards, i', 'e', 'a harmonised, competitive and innovative European card payments area', 'Without wanting to pre-empt the discussions at this conference, I would first like to highlight three areas that are critical to the realisation of the SEPA for cards: standardisation, interoperability and security', 'Secondly, I would like to touch upon the issue of innovation and how it will impact cards', 'SEPA for cards: standardisation, interoperability and security In 2015 the Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB) took stock of the market initiatives which are developing technical standards for payment cards in the EU, basing its conclusions on a detailed report by the Cards Stakeholders Group', 'As a result, the ERPB issued some recommendations on the implementation of the requirements developed in the SEPA Cards Standardisation Volume (SCS Volume) in respect of different domains (terminal-to-acquirer, card-to-terminal, terminal security)', 'Progress with these recommendations will be further monitored', 'Interoperability concerns both the technical compatibility of cards and card terminals (one of the domains for which the ERPB has issued recommendations) and cards processing', 'Given the presence of multiple card schemes, multiple banks and multiple processors in Europe, the Eurosystem has repeatedly called for the development of a framework for the processing of card payments as well as an interoperability framework for SEPA-compliant card transaction processing', 'The technical interoperability of card processors and card schemes – based on European standards – is a key issue when it comes to realising the SEPA for cards', 'And technical interoperability is required by the EU’s Regulation on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions (IFR), which will apply as of June 2016', 'Schemes and processors that want to survive in the SEPA for cards will have to become “pan-European” by moving towards interoperability based on European standards', 'As regards the third critical area, security and the fight against fraud related to card payments in SEPA countries have been high on the agenda of the Eurosystem', 'The work of France’s Observatoire de la sécurité des cartes de paiement (Observatory for Payment Card Security) has been a benchmark in that area', 'Furthermore, since 2012, the ECB has published the Eurosystem’s findings on card fraud in an annual report', 'What we have observed is that two-thirds of all fraud losses on cards issued within SEPA countries is related to CNP transactions', 'This fraud involves card payments for purchases made via the internet, the phone network or by email', 'Hence, the adoption of appropriate mitigation measures, such as the implementation of strong customer authentication, is indispensable to avoid a further rise in CNP fraud in the Single Euro Payments Area', 'The Guidelines on the security of internet payments of the European Banking Authority (EBA) published in December 2014 impose a minimum set of security requirements to be implemented by payment service providers', 'These guidelines are themselves based on the recommendations issued by the European Forum on the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay)', 'Accordingly, I encourage all participants – not only payment service providers but also e-merchants – to keep up their efforts to improve the protection of internet payments and swiftly adopt strong authentication solutions', 'The drawing up of Level 2 regulatory technical standards and guidelines by the EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, will provide the market with further guidance on security issues related to internet payments', 'Impact of innovation on cards As I have said in the introduction, the emergence of innovative payment solutions will impact payment behaviour and the usage of cards and other traditional payment instruments in the years to come', 'Innovative card-based solutions for contactless proximity payments, e-commerce wallets or mobile person-to-person payments have the potential to further boost card usage by replacing cash payments, particularly vis-à-vis person-to-person payments and small purchases', 'At the same time, the card industry will be challenged by strong competition from innovative payment solutions based on payment instruments other than cards', 'One of these challenges is instant payments', 'The ERPB has decided that the European Payments Council should develop an instant payment scheme for euro payments that is based on the SEPA credit transfer', 'With regard to e-commerce, another challenge arises from the emergence of new payment service providers', 'Payment initiation services and online payment integrators are expected to enter the payments chain with their service offerings', 'Then there is the challenge of distributed ledger technologies', 'These technologies, of which Blockchain is probably the best-known example, can potentially have a profound impact on the whole financial “ecosystem”', 'Their adoption has the potential to disrupt both the use of “traditional” payment instruments and services and the payments processing industry', 'The Eurosystem welcomes more choice for consumers and businesses, provided that the payment solutions offered in the market are secure and efficient and that both new and established providers play by the same rules', 'The revised Directive on Payment Services (PSD2) and the IFR have laid down the rules of the game and provide the required clarity', 'The EBA is now developing regulatory technical standards on separation of payment card schemes and processing entities (under the IFR) and also regulatory technical standards on strong customer authentication and secure communication (under the PSD2)', 'I am sure that we will learn more about this during the course of this conference', 'Conclusion Please allow me to conclude', 'I am convinced that cards are here to stay', 'Moreover, there is still a huge growth potential for card transactions in the EU', 'To unleash this growth potential, the SEPA for cards has to be realised', 'A harmonised, competitive and innovative European card payments area must be achieved by means of standardisation, interoperability and appropriate security measures', 'Card schemes and card processors that want to stay in the market have to become pan-European', 'At the same time, innovative payment solutions will pose a challenge to the cards industry', 'It will face competition from instant payments based on the SEPA credit transfer, from payment initiation services in the area of e-commerce and from the adoption of distributed ledger technologies', 'This competition is welcome, provided the solutions offered in

here in Oviedo', 'I am very grateful to the organiser – Alfonso Novales – for giving me the opportunity to address this audience today and to share with you some reflections on the current financial crisis and the role of central banks in responding to it', 'We are currently experiencing one of the deepest and most complex crises witnessed by the world for many decades', 'The turmoil stemming from a relatively small segment of the US mortgage market (the sub-prime segment) has developed over time into a global crisis affecting a number of economies and markets all over the world', 'The global dimension of the crisis as well as its complexity have posed a number of challenges for policy makers, forcing them to introduce exceptional measures and use innovative modalities of intervention', 'In particular, increasing awareness that the current crisis has the potential to jeopardise systemic financial stability and undermine macroeconomic stability worldwide has led to public authorities developing a common understanding of the causes of the crisis and of the concerted actions needed to address them', 'Thus, a high degree of cooperation among public authorities both at national and international level has become a hallmark of public interventions throughout the current crisis', 'A highly symbolic episode of international policy cooperation during the crisis was the announcement of a coordinated interest rate cut by the ECB and five other major central banks (the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank) in October 2008', 'This coordinated interest rate cut was unprecedented by historical standards and was interpreted as a sign of the strong commitment of the international central banking community to addressing the macroeconomic implications of the financial market turmoil', 'International cooperation among central banks has also been remarkable in the area of liquidity management', 'First, through enhanced information sharing and collective monitoring of market developments and, later on, by means of coordinated steps to provide liquidity, central banks have cooperated from the start of the crisis to guarantee the smooth functioning of global money markets and provide support to the international banking system', 'The first initiative in this direction was the agreement in December 2007 between the Eurosystem and the US Federal Reserve to grant loans in US dollars to euro area counterparties in connection with the Fed’s Term Auction Facility', 'The need to strengthen liquidity provision in order to address the global liquidity squeeze and ease pressures in international money markets has also led to central banks adjusting their operational frameworks in order to increase their effectiveness and expanding their ability to reach markets under stress', 'This has resulted in a certain degree of international convergence of the operational frameworks', 'As part of the adjustments to their operational frameworks, some central banks have extended lending to institutions other than depository banks, including non-bank financial institutions and even directly to the real sector', 'Direct lending to the real sector represents a significant deviation from the traditional central banking practice of using banks as the main channel of transmission of central bank liquidity', 'But this is not the only area in which the crisis has prompted central bankers to reconsider their existing practices', 'The issue of the optimal response of monetary policy to asset price bubbles is also being re-examined, with the prevailing view - postulating that a central bank’s policy interest rate is too blunt an instrument to address bubbles – coming under much stricter scrutiny that it has being subjected to in the past decade', 'Finally, the need to strengthen the role of central banks in preserving financial stability has also become the focus of the policy debate as efforts are made to address the causes of the crisis', 'The recognition that market failures as well as regulatory and supervisory deficiencies are at the root of the crisis has prompted the relevant public and private fora to make significant efforts to identify weaknesses in the international financial sector and develop measures to restore its smooth functioning', 'In the case of Europe, there is increasing concern that the current prudential framework based on national regulatory and supervisory regimes cannot address the many challenges arising from the activities of large, complex and highly interdependent financial institutions operating across borders', 'To sum up, the current crisis is likely to bring important changes for the future of the economic and financial systems in which we live', 'These include changes in the nature of the relationship and degree of coordination among the different policies and public authorities, revisions to the regulatory and supervisory domains as well as reforms of the international financial architecture', 'Therefore, we are likely to witness a number of institutional changes that will bring about a new environment for policy-making in a number of areas related to central banking', '2', 'A new environment for central banking', 'I should like to share with you some thoughts on this potential new environment', 'In order to do so, I will organise my intervention around six specific issues among those that in my view deserve particular attention:    Should we increase policy coordination at the domestic level', 'Should there be more international monetary policy coordination', 'Should we see more international convergence in liquidity frameworks', 'Should central banks increase direct lending to the real economy', 'Should asset prices being given more weight in monetary policy considerations', 'Should central banks be more involved in supervision', '2', '1 More domestic policy coordination', 'As we have seen, policy responses both at the global and the European level have been characterised by an increasing degree of coordination', 'A natural question, therefore, seems to be whether in the future greater policy coordination at the level of the euro area or the EU should be warranted', 'Given the existence of the single currency in the euro area, I will first focus on the coordination among national fiscal policies', 'On the fiscal side, a key challenge for the future is to prevent the financial crisis from eventually undermining the sustainability and credibility of public finances', 'What can we do to prevent this from happening', 'At this point, let me reiterate that the Stability and Growth Pact already provides a coordination device for fiscal policies and, in particular, provides peer pressure mechanisms for sound and sustainable public finances', 'It provides the appropriate framework for the conduct and coordination of fiscal policies in good times and also in bad times', 'The challenge at times of crisis is, thus, to use this existing mechanism to the best effect', 'To put it rather bluntly, we should not tinker with the keel just because the wind is strong; the Pact is already flexible enough to allow room for the policy to adjust without undermining the foundations for a sustainable path', 'Indeed, EU countries are already facing considerable long-term challenges from the costs associated with population ageing that should be borne in mind when considering short-term demand policies', 'If the starting position is less strong, an inappropriate short-term response may make us literally “age faster” by exposing even more strongly the need for adjustments to cope with the long-term challenges', 'Countries with large deficit and/or debt levels may be particularly vulnerable in this regard', 'Unfortunately, many euro area countries entered the financial crisis and the economic downturn with unnecessarily weak fiscal balances, having missed the opportunity presented by past years’ revenue windfalls to consolidate their budgets', 'While this is never a popular message even in normal times, it still deserves mention so that the mistakes can be avoided once the crisis has passed', 'Indeed one of the fiscal policy errors prior to and including 2000-01 was to mistakenly interpret budgetary improvements in good times as evidence of structural improvements, which were often used to motivate spending increases or tax cuts', 'On a positive note, we can say that while compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact during its first ten years has been somewhat uneven, the EU’s overall fiscal performance in terms of avoiding high budget deficits and the build-up of government debt was much better than in the decades preceding the Pact', '[1] Indeed, some of the EU countries that comply with the Stability and Growth Pact can now take advantage of their relatively large automatic stabilisers to do much of the work', 'These accomplishments should be a guiding beacon', 'Sound fiscal policies with a strong keel provide the basis for stability and the necessary conditions for good long-term growth in the challenging seas ahead', 'One additional dimension of policy coordination in the euro area is that between the single monetary policy and the national fiscal policies of the Member States', 'In this respect, the institutional set-up of European Monetary Union consists of a clear and efficient assignment of objectives and instruments to the different authorities, together with a strict division of responsibilities', 'The ECB must focus on its primary mandate of delivering medium-term price stability under conditions of full independence', 'Fiscal policy must focus on its traditional objectives related to allocation, redistribution and stabilisation (to varying extents), while contributing to maintaining an environment of macroeconomic stability', 'Of course, in setting monetary policy the ECB takes into account the fiscal policy stance, as one of the factors which contribute to the outlook for price stability over the medium term', 'It goes without saying that an open exchange of views and information among the different authorities is welcome if it enhances a common understanding of desirable objectives and strategies to pursue them', 'However, there cannot be any scope for active ex-ante coordination of fiscal and monetary policies', 'Indeed, a commitment to ex ante coordination between fiscal and monetary policies may blur the responsibilities of the various authorities at the expense of accountability and may ultimately reduce their incentives to pursue their objectives', 'Thus, the current macroeconomic policy framework in the euro area based on a separation of responsibilities is the most appropriate to ensure sustained and non-inflationary economic growth', '2', '2 More international monetary policy coordination', 'While cooperation in the field of liquidity management on an unprecedented scale has been certainly one of the hallmarks of public responses to the current turmoil, another example without precedents of central bank coordination was the decision by the ECB and five other major central banks to ease global monetary conditions on 8 October 2008', 'Commentators and observers have wondered whether this concerted policy decision may be the beginning of a new era of increased international monetary policy coordination in response to economic and financial globalisation', 'It is important to stress that this coordinated interest rate cut was taken in a specific context and with a specific objective', 'There was extraordinary uncertainty at the time about the economic outlook and strong evidence that upside risks to price stability had diminished at the global level', 'The coordinated cut addressed the need to respond to a common shock that was being transmitted around the globe almost simultaneously', 'Through the joint communication, the international central banking community provided a signal of its strong commitment to responding to the macroeconomic implications of the financial market turmoil', 'There is no doubt that over the past three decades the trade, economic and financial linkages among the different regions of the work have grown tighter, and of course policy-makers take this into account in the design of their policies', 'However, when talking about international policy coordination, it is important to define clearly what we mean', 'Policy coordination does not mean, of course, that all central banks need to adopt the same policy stance for the entire world and certainly it cannot be a surrogate for domestic macroeconomic prudence nor weaken the commitment of each central bank to its institutional objective', 'Indeed, differences in cyclical positions, structures of the economies (e', 'g', 'in terms of market rigidities and frictions, sectoral leverage, financial systems, etc', '), monetary policy institutional frameworks as well as shocks hitting the economy almost necessarily lead to differences in deciding the appropriate monetary policy stance', 'Thus, systematic monetary policy coordination may eventually come at the cost of weakening a central bank’s commitment to its institutional objective', 'For central banks, international policy coordination is better understood as the continuous cooperation and exchange of information at both staff and decision-making levels, shared experienced and mutual understanding and trust, which very much lies on the consensus among central banks that monetary policies geared towards domestic price stability, sound public finances and flexible economic structures do create the conditions for long-term economic growth and financial stability', '2', '3 More international convergence in liquidity frameworks', 'Since August 2007 central banks have responded in a variety of ways to the financial market disruptions, reflecting differences in the extent to which markets have been hit by the turbulences, and differences in the design of their operational frameworks', 'However, in general all major central banks stepped up their intermediation role with a view to addressing the liquidity squeeze and, in doing so, they showed a certain degree of convergence in operating procedures', 'In particular, central banks:    Pursued more active reserve management, reassuring banks of their orderly access to overnight funds and increasing the frequency of their operations', 'Increased the supply of funds (notably long-term); expanded to varying degrees the definition of collateral accepted in collateralised lending operations; provided access to collateralised lending to a large number of counterparties', 'Adapted tender procedures for open market operations in the direction of price rather than quantity-based schemes, akin to those used for standing facilities', 'As the turbulence developed, central banks strengthened their cooperation through enhanced communication and collective market monitoring and coordinated actions to provide liquidity', 'In this respect, a significant number of swap lines between central banks have been set up to facilitate the distribution of foreign currency liquidity to domestic counterparties', 'Overall, one lesson we can draw from the turmoil is that there are certain key operational features that facilitate the implementation of monetary policy under stress', 'In particular, central banks are better positioned to distribute reserves effectively — when the interbank lending is impaired — if they are capable of providing access to collateralised lending operations on a large scale to a wide set of counterparties and against a broad range of collateral', 'Yet, a very important issue, on which I myself have no clear answer, is how – not so much whether but rather how – this convergence in the understanding of the “optimal” features of the operational framework under stress, should be reflected by the design of the operational framework in the steady state', 'For this, we need, in particular, to develop a better understanding of the optimal mix between private market and central bank intermediation and we need to carefully liaise with supervisory bodies', 'I should clarify that when I say “optimal” in this context, I do not mean “uniform”', 'To the extent that monetary policy strategies, central banks’ status vis-à-vis governments, and certain specific features of domestic financial systems persist, the optimal liquidity frameworks of each country or monetary union should reflect such country or area-specific factors', '2', '4 More scope for direct lending to the real economy', 'An additional issue that has come to the fore during the present crisis, especially in the last few months, concerns the extent to which central banks may engage in direct lending to the real economy', 'This is not a purely theoretical subject, as the recent establishment by the Federal Reserve System of several liquidity facilities directed to non-banks shows (for instance, those directed to money market funds and issuers of commercial paper)', 'In principle, the scope for direct lending by the central bank to the real economy should depend on the extent to which the malfunctioning of the money and credit markets distorts bank lending and prevents aggregate households and businesses from obtaining credit', 'In that sense, some central banks have decided to bypass the banking system and start lending to households and firms directly for the sake of preserving the orderly functioning of the economy', 'In practice, even abstracting from possible legal constraints (e', 'g', 'prohibition of monetary financing to the state in the European Monetary Union), there are several issues that central banks must consider before deciding on the appropriateness for their “own” economies of providing direct financing to the real sector', 'I stress the term “own” because this is one of those cases in which there is no unique answer', 'Whether or not a central bank engages in direct lending will very much depend on a number of considerations referring to structural features of the economy, the gravity of the crisis, the state of the financial system and a number of institutional factors, notably those governing the relationship between the central bank and the government', 'For instance, one apparently straightforward observation is that the need to provide direct credit to the economy at times of dysfunctions in banking activity is likely to depend on the relative importance of the banking sector for financial intermediation', 'Following this argument, one may argue that in a bank-based economy there may be relatively less need to provide credit to agents other than banks than in a market-based economy', 'Indeed, by focusing on providing support to the banking sector, the central bank may increase its chances of sustaining the economy as a whole', 'However, under extreme circumstances (notably, when the banking sector is no longer able to fulfil its institutional role as the main engine of financial intermediation), a central bank may reach the opposite conclusion: exactly because of the banking sector’s predominance in financial intermediation, its dysfunctional state might prompt a central bank to intervene before the entire economy comes to a halt', 'If so, the central bank will need to decide which sectors to target', 'Once again, this is not an easy choice', 'It may imply the need for the central bank to take decisions on the optimal allocation of resources in the economy which, historical experience shows, are better left to the private sector', 'Other concerns may relate to the risk of political pressure and government interference, especially if the scale of the financing programme requires support from the Treasury', 'If financing is ensured through the expansion of the central bank’s liabilities, this may give rise to more general concerns about the fiscal costs of actions taken by the monetary authority', '[2] Finally, but related to the previous arguments, direct lending to the real economy may imply an increase in the financial risks taken by the central bank, potentially exposing the latter to risks to its financial independence and, ultimately, to its institutional independence', 'The purpose of these remarks is certainly not to suggest that central banks should abstain from direct lending to the real sector, but rather to point out that the number of aspects to consider before doing so are so many and of such complexity that no central bank would ever take such a decision with a light heart', 'This is why, before embarking on such a policy, some central banks may prefer to provide indirect support (i', 'e', 'through banks) to the real economy', 'Based on the considerations, the Eurosystem has chosen to make full use of the possibilities provided by its operational framework to support the economy, using the banking sector as an intermediary agent', 'Indeed, the euro area’s financial system is still predominantly bank-based, despite despite significant changes in the area’s financial landscape in recent decades (as a result of a number of structural developments, including the introduction of the euro)', 'Just to illustrate this point, in 2007 aggregate bank lending to the private sector amounted to 145% of GDP in the euro area, compared with 63% in the US', 'By contrast, the ratio of outstanding debt securities issued by the euro area private sector relative to GDP (81%) was less than half than in the US', 'Thus, banks play such a dominant role in the euro area economy that, guaranteeing steady access to credit for households and companies in the euro area to a large extent means preserving the viability of the banking system', 'The Eurosystem does so by providing banks with unlimited access at fixed rates to its refinancing operations (of course, against adequate collateral)', 'More recently, the Eurosystem has announced plans to purchase euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area to provide further support to credit provision by the banking sector', 'These purchases will target an important segment of the private securities market, which has been particularly affected by the financial market turbulence and will contribute to achieve the objective of maintaining the availability of credit for households and companies at accessible rates', '2', '5 More weight given to asset prices in monetary policy', 'Another interesting debate that has gained – for obvious reasons – renewed interest and strength over the past year is the role that asset prices should take in the monetary policy design', 'Indeed, as we are experiencing at present, large volatility in asset prices can jeopardise the stability of the financial system and potentially undermine macroeconomic stability', 'The repetition of boom-bust cycles and the potentially very high costs for macroeconomic stability associated with the typically abrupt reversal of asset price bubbles beg the question: should monetary policy give more weight to asset prices', 'There are various arguments that must be carefully weighed in order to answer this question', 'First, we know that bubbles are extremely difficult to identify in real time', 'Assessing whether or not asset prices are being driven by fundamentals is surrounded with so much uncertainty — perhaps sometimes uncertainty in the “Knigthian” sense — that central banks should refrain from targeting asset prices', 'Moreover, some hold the view that, while monetary policy actions can influence asset price developments, the magnitude of the swings in policy rates that would be needed to curb boom and bust cycles in asset prices at times of “irrational exuberance” could be so large as to have adverse implications for macroeconomic stability in the short term', '[3]  Based on these arguments, which are broadly shared in the central banking and academic community, one policy view (perhaps, the predominant view in the past years) postulates that it is better to wait for the bubble to burst on its own and then ease monetary policy aggressively to provide support to the banking system and to the economy', 'This is the so-called “mop up after” approach', 'In this case, sharp monetary policy easing after the bursting of the bubble is supportive of both price stability and financial stability, though at the possible expense of creating moral hazard and excessive risk-taking in future boom times', 'An alternative approach consists of “leaning against the wind”', 'According to this approach, monetary policy should be conducted in a “symmetric” manner over the financial cycle', 'In other words, it should be accommodative at a time of falling asset prices, but restrictive during a financial market boom', 'For instance, the central bank should conduct a slightly tighter monetary policy than warranted by its price stability objective, when the build-up of a potentially detrimental asset price boom is identified', 'By doing so, the central bank would buy insurance against the risk of a harmful asset boom-bust cycle, with its potential costs in terms of macroeconomic and financial stability', 'The main argument against this approach is that the insurance premium associated with such policy may be excessively high', 'In fact, a contractionary policy response to asset price increases may end up destabilising the economy if the asset price revaluation is driven by fundamentals', 'This risk is related to the difficulty that I have just mentioned concerning the identification of asset price misalignments in real time', 'This risk, however, should not act as a perfect alibi for policy inaction', 'As the recent literature on early indicators [4] started by researchers at the BIS shows, there are indicators based on money and credit developments that can provide guidance on the nature and the consequences of extraordinary asset price developments, and thereby help to define the need for policy action', 'As the current financial crisis illustrates, the macroeconomic costs of financial instability and the challenges that it poses for the maintenance of price stability provide support to the case for a flexible “leaning against the wind” strategy', 'More generally, a lesson from the current crisis seems to be that central banks should assign a greater role to asset prices in monetary policy considerations and should aim to pre-empt the emergence of asset price bubbles', 'How can one implement such a policy approach in practice', 'The answer very much depends on the monetary policy framework specifically adopted by a central bank', 'Central banks following inflation targeting, the most commonly adopted strategy among developing and emerging countries, may find it relatively difficult to make this approach fit in their policy framework', 'Indeed, inflation targeters tend to concentrate on the pursuit of price stability at specific horizons and generally assign low weight to the need to monitor asset prices or other indicators (notably, monetary and credit variables) that may signal the building up of financial imbalances', '[5]  In response to these concerns, some inflation targeters have specified further information, not included in macroeconomic forecasts, which should be taken into account in order to formulate monetary policy decisions', 'Such information includes, inter alia, the monitoring of credit and property price conditions', 'In addition, some inflation targeting central banks have relaxed the strict focus on a specific forecast horizon for monetary policy, by explicitly referring to a “medium term” horizon or by enlarging the horizon of their macroeconomic projections, also to take into account challenges stemming from asset price developments', 'I should like to stress that the ECB’s two-pillar monetary policy strategy is well suited to cope with the challenges brought about by asset price developments', '[6] More precisely, there are two features of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy that may provide a suitable framework to implement a “leaning against the wind” approach:    First, the ECB’s definition of price stability objective – an inflation rate below, but close to, 2% in the medium term – allows the conduct of a more restrictive monetary policy during a period of booming asset prices, even in an environment of relatively subdued inflationary pressures', 'In this case, “leaning against the wind” would likely result in lower inflation over the short term, but would be expected to be more effective in maintaining price stability over the longer term, by helping to prevent the materialisation of deflation risks when the asset bubble bursts', 'Second, the ECB’s analysis of monetary and credit developments [7] aimed at identifying longer-term inflation risks can also provide signals of growing financial imbalances, which could in principle be used to implement a policy of “leaning against the wind”', 'This is because there is a close link between monetary and credit developments and evolving imbalances in asset and credit markets', '[8] By exploiting this link, our monetary analysis (consisting of a comprehensive assessment of liquidity and credit conditions) may provide early information on developing asset price imbalances and, therefore, allow for a timely response to the implied risks to price and financial stability', 'Thus, the ECB’s two-pillar strategy may represent a practical way of mimicking the “leaning against the wind” approach', '2', '6 More central bank involvement in supervision', 'The recent financial market crisis has also highlighted the important role that central banks play in safeguarding financial stability and the need to increase interaction between central banks and banking supervisors', 'This need for increased interaction, also identified by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in one of its recommendations, would further support and enhance the central banks’ role in financial stability assessments, crisis management and resolution, and liquidity provision', 'First , with regard to financial stability assessment : central banks can benefit from extended access to supervisory information especially in relation to systemically relevant institutions, in order to identify risks and vulnerabilities for the financial system as a whole in a more efficient way', 'In this context, the FSB and the International Monetary Fund are already intensifying their cooperation with a view to enhancing the assessment of financial stability risks on a global scale, while in the EU the same is valid for the Banking Supervision Committee and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors', 'These efforts should also be mirrored at the national and regional levels, through the intensification of the cooperation and exchange of information between central banks and supervisory authorities for an overall better monitoring and assessment of risks to the financial system', 'The other side of this coin relates to the issue of incorporating the outcome of the financial stability risk analysis into policy action in the field of supervision, which also needs to be reinforced', 'Second, in the area of crisis management and resolution : the global nature of financial markets and the increased interlinkages between markets and institutions requires competent financial authorities, central banks, supervisors and ministries of finance to strengthen their coordination mechanisms for the management of crisis involving cross-border financial institutions', 'In the EU, an important milestone has been reached with the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the competent authorities of all Member States in June 2008', 'This MoU establishes common principles, procedures and terminology to be used by all parties involved in a cross-border crisis', 'Third, in relation to liquidity provision: in order to maintain stable money markets, central banks would benefit from enhanced access to supervisory information, including liquidity stress-testing and contingency funding plans of banks', 'At the same time, supervisors would benefit from information available at central banks, such as banks’ bidding behaviour', 'Overall, while the need for enhanced interaction between central banks and supervisory authorities is widely acknowledged, recent events have called into question whether improved interaction in cooperation suffices', 'In this context, the debate has recently turned towards the future supervisory architecture', 'In particular, the financial crisis has underscored the urgency of reviewing the EU supervisory framework, which is still based on national responsibilities against the background of increased financial market integration and the growing role of large cross-border financial institutions', 'In response to these concerns, a High Level Group was set up under the chairmanship of Mr Jacques de Larosiére with the mandate to examine the allocation of tasks between the national and the European level', 'The final report of the group, published last February, includes a number of proposals to strengthen both macro- and micro-supervisory arrangements in Europe', 'As regards the arrangements for macro-prudential supervision, the De Larosière report proposes to establish a European Systemic Risk Board under the auspices of the ECB, which should substantially improve the assessment of systemic risks to financial stability at the EU level', 'By assigning a strong role to central banks, and particularly to the ECB, the report recognises that these institutions should play a leading role in macro-prudential supervision', 'However, in order for the new Board to perform its tasks in an optimal manner, it is important that three key requirements are fulfilled:    First, the ECB must have timely access to all relevant information, including that concerning individual institutions;    Second, risk warnings from the new Council should be translated into effective policy action;    And third, the new Council must have a solid institutional and legal basis in order to ensure independence and effectiveness of its decision-making processes', '3', 'Concluding remarks    The financial turmoil, which began in the summer of 2007, has developed over time into one of the most disruptive crises that the world has experienced in many decades', 'This is why from the start of the turmoil public authorities have undertaken interventions in key policy fields, including liquidity management, monetary policy and fiscal policy, which are unprecedented by number and scale', 'In addition, many initiatives have been undertaken to address weaknesses in the regulatory and supervisory framework in order to provide sounder foundations to our financial systems', 'Despite our best efforts, we cannot yet see the light at the end of the tunnel and key financial markets and economic sectors remain under stress', 'It would be very difficult to predict when exactly our economies will return to normality, but I would be prepared to bet that, when this finally happens, the world will look different in many respects', 'In this speech I have focused on six specific areas of relevance for central banks that are, to a varying extent, in a state of flux', 'They may all lead to changes in the environment in which central banks operate', 'By increasing our efforts to draw the right lessons from the crisis and implementing the necessary reforms, especially in the regulatory and supervisory frameworks, we can make sure that in the future the environment surrounding central banks will not be just different, but also more conducive to price and financial stability', '[1] See the article entitled “Ten years of the Stability and Growth Pact”, ECB Monthly Bulletin, October 2008', '[2] See Cukierman, A', '(2006), “Central

teacher', 'He taught his students to think for themselves and did not pass on a binding creed', 'He helped his students – economists, thinkers, servants of the state and of the institutions, alert citizens – to discover themselves', 'I’ll start with the subject which, without a doubt, was the most precious to Caffè, namely welfare', 'Probably nothing in his intellectual heritage is more topical than this painful protest of his: one cannot, he would say, “ accept the idea that an entire generation of young people should consider themselves as having being born at the wrong time and having to suffer job insecurity as an inevitable fact”', '[2]   Work: a European matter “ Full employment is not only a means of increasing production', ', it is an end in itself, since it leads to overcoming the servile attitude of those who find it hard to obtain a job opportunity or live in constant fear of being deprived of one', 'In other words, the benefits of full employment are considered as well, and above all, in terms of human dignity', '” These words of Caffè do not surprise those who knew him and those who have read his works', 'They express the fundamental inspiration of his professional and public life: it is a duty of economic policy to act so that the economy can get as close as possible to full employment', 'In 1975, he formulated it more precisely: “ The goal of dignified work for all, however, is not compatible either with situations of privilege, which have now become destabilising, nor with excessive labour and social security rights, which results in job opportunities evaporating away”   The issue that Caffè raises here is one of fairness', 'We find it again today: the international crisis has affected everyone, and young people especially', 'In the European Union, between 2007 and 2011 the unemployment rate rose by 5', '8 percentage points among the 15-24 year olds, by 3', '5 points among the 25-34 year olds and by 1', '8 points in the 35-64 age range', 'Qualitatively, the profile is similar almost everywhere; the clear exception is Germany, where the unemployment rate among 15 to 24 year olds in the first quarter of 2012 was 8%; in Italy it was 34', '2%, in Spain 50', '7% and the euro area average was 21', '9%', 'These trends reflect a fundamental question: they confirm the particular vulnerability of this essential part of our workforce', 'The unequal sharing of the “cost of flexibility”, only affecting young people, an eternal flexibility with no hope of stabilisation, leads among other things to companies not investing in young people, whose skills and talents often decline in jobs with low added value', 'The underuse of their resources reduces growth in various ways: it makes the creation of start-ups less likely – and they are on average more innovative than others – it causes a decline in skills in the long run, slowing down the assimilation of new technology and acting as a brake on efficient production processes', 'In addition to undermining society’s sense of fairness, it is a waste that we cannot afford', 'I think it’s essential to ask how economic policy conducted in various Member States has done its duty in the way desired by Caffè', 'Social progress is one of the key objectives of the European integration process: “ The Union shall work for the sustainable development of Europe based on balanced economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress … It shall combat social exclusion and discrimination, and shall promote social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and protection of the rights of the child”', '(Article I-3 of the draft European Constitution)', 'Welfare is not only a remedy for the failure of insurance markets, but also a tool to promote inclusion, solidarity and a sense of fairness', 'In the three post-war decades (the so-called “Golden Age”), which especially in Europe were marked by high growth rates, use of advanced technologies, high growth employment, stable lifetime employment, welfare started to emerge, at different times and on different scales depending on the country, as an integrated system that protects its citizens from significant risks', 'The European model redistributes many more resources for social purposes than the US and Japanese systems: on the eve of the crisis, the total expenditure on pensions, unemployment benefit, for children and families was, in relation to GDP, more than twice that of the US and Japan', 'This can take different forms as regards the composition of social policies and the degree of labour protection', 'In Italy, with an overall welfare spending ratio of GDP in line with that of the rest of Europe, spending on support for the unemployed, for households, particularly those at risk of falling into poverty, is at a level less than half that of elsewhere in Europe, while spending on pensions is significantly higher', 'The weakness of the “social shock absorbers” is that relatively high job protection for those in employment is accompanied by weaker protection for those out of work, contrary to what happens in the Nordic models, where the so-called “flexisecurity” combines an extensive social safety net with less job protection', 'In some countries, even if, 40 years on, the assumptions of that model are still valid, reflections on it began some time ago', 'Structural factors have changed the context within which the European social model operates: the growing competition from emerging countries, the reorganisation of production processes on a global basis, the speed of innovation, the increasing fragmentation of career paths with ever looser ties to a “permanent position”, the greater instability of families, declining fertility, the prospective decrease in the workforce, an ageing population', 'The set of risks faced by individuals throughout their life has changed significantly', 'The social protection systems are therefore constantly evolving; substantial corrections have taken place in recent years in many countries, including France, the United Kingdom and Germany, the country where the reform process began a decade ago', 'In Italy, the recent pension reform which approves the full transition to a contribution system completes the necessary correction of the pension spending dynamics which was started years ago', 'As Germany shows very well, large and effective welfare systems can be made more efficient without compromising social goals', 'We are living at a critical juncture in the history of the Union', 'The sovereign debt crisis has exposed serious weaknesses in the institutional framework; in this context, the difficulties in finding common solutions are having a negative impact on market valuations', 'The extraordinary measures taken by the ECB have gained us time; they have preserved the functioning of monetary policy', 'But we have now reached a point where European integration, in order to survive, needs a bold leap of political imagination', 'It is in this sense that I have referred to the need for a “growth compact” alongside the well-known “fiscal compact”', 'A growth compact rests on three pillars and the most important one, from a structural viewpoint, is political: the economic and financial crisis has challenged the myopic belief that monetary union could remain just that, and not evolve into something closer, more binding, into an arrangement whereby national sovereignty on economic policy is replaced by the Community ruling', 'If the governments of the Member States of the euro define jointly and irrevocably their vision of what the political and economic construct that supports the single currency will be and what the conditions to reach that goal together should be', 'This is the most effective answer to the question everyone is asking: “Where will the euro be in ten years’ time', '”', 'The second pillar is that of structural reforms, especially, but not only, in the product and labour markets', 'The completion of the single market and the strengthening of competition are crucial for growth and employment', 'Labour market reforms that combine flexibility and mobility with a sense of fairness and social inclusion are essential', 'Growth and fairness are closely connected: without growth, and the events of recent months also reflect this, the temptation to “circle our wagons” gains strength, and solidarity weakens', 'Without fairness, the economy breaks up into multiple interest groups, no common good emerges as a result of social and economic interaction, and there are negative effects on the capacity to grow', 'Recent Italian history has no shortage of examples', 'These reforms have long been indispensable in a global economy very different to the one which witnessed the creation of the institutions still operating today', 'In the political structure that will emerge from the crisis it is likely and desirable that for these reforms a system of European rules will be introduced similar to that for the fiscal compact, a discipline leading over time to the European harmonisation of objectives and tools', 'The third pillar is the revival of public investment: the use of public resources to push forward investment in infrastructure and human capital, research and innovation at national and European levels', '(The proposed strengthening of the EIB and the reprogramming of Union structural funds in favour of less-developed areas go in this direction)', 'Thus, a growth compact complements the fiscal compact, because there can be no sustainable growth without orderly public finances', 'In this regard I have noted on other occasions the extraordinary progress made by all governments of the euro area in terms of fiscal consolidation, but, once the emergency is overcome, they need to make improvements by cutting current spending and taxation', 'Let me now consider some issues more directly related to the ECB’s monetary policy and action', 'Objectives and instruments The first issue involves the relationship between objectives and instruments of economic policy in a macroeconomic reference model that changes over time', 'For Caffè, one of the first scholars of Frisch and Tinbergen, the optimal allocation of tools and objectives occurred in the reference model prevalent in the 1970s, in which the goal of economic policy was to make best use of the available resources, in particular full employment', 'In pursuit of this goal, monetary policy was subordinated to fiscal policy, with an ancillary role for the central bank vis-à-vis the Treasury', 'The reference macro-model was based on a static mechanism of elaborating expectations, which were formed by extrapolating from past observations to the future', 'This mechanism amplified the immediate effect of public spending on aggregate demand', 'Monetary policy – in charge of credit conditions – was entrusted with the task of alleviating, through a careful policy of accommodation, the impact that government borrowing would have exerted on the cost of private debt', 'The central bank was financing the Treasury by creating money', 'Under these conditions, an increase in public spending could “add demand” – where this would be lacking for the goal of full employment – without taking away resources from other uses', 'Since then, the theory of economic policy has followed two paths that have led it to invert the ranking of relative potential of tools and to enhance the definition and measurement of the objective', 'As for the instruments, a different theory of the formation of expectations – no longer extrapolative – has highlighted the strong impact of monetary policy and has weakened the expected effects of fiscal policy', 'In the models that we use today, agents, when formulating their expectations, are attentive to the sustainability conditions of the choices in the long term', 'Economic policies deemed unsustainable in the long run are ineffective', 'For example, an active deficit-financed fiscal policy is limited by fears about the government’s ability to refinance the debt from which that policy originates', 'These fears may lead to behaviours that weaken the private sector – or, at worst, completely neutralise – the impact of public spending as a means of controlling demand', 'Monetary policy, by contrast, is strengthened by this', 'Acting through the expectations channel, it can have a lasting effect on the expected flows of financial revenue', 'Affecting the real rate of intertemporal discount, it can deeply affect decisions on savings and consumption', 'The definition of the objective is now wider', 'Price stability has become an essential parameter in defining and measuring prosperity', 'From taking a relaxed approach to inflation and considering it secondary, nowadays low and predictable inflation is a pre-eminent criterion of economic performance', 'Why', 'High inflation hits savings – and therefore investment and future consumption – with a tax on real returns that rewards the risk of uncertain inflation', 'Low inflation, however, frees up resources that individual choices can allocate to increasing the fixed capital', 'A policy that neglects inflation gradually destabilises the economy', 'The costs of uncertainty about the value of the money, initially unimportant, then overlooked, subsequently become evident, and then are judged intolerable', 'At that point, voters express a strong preference for policies that promise rapid disinflation', 'But such policies impose high costs in terms of job losses, which have to be included in the dynamic calculation of the costs of inflation', 'Also, it should not be forgotten that inflation affects the poor more than the rich, and is therefore a tax on the weaker members of society', 'Under the influence of the neo-classical synthesis of Samuelson and Solow, the long-term correlation between inflation and growth was perceived as positive in the early 1970s: a slight increase in inflation would have led – within limits – to an increase in employment and growth', '[3] But by the end of that decade, studies by Bob Lucas and Tom Sargent were to show that long-term inflation and growth are not correlated', '[4] Monetary policy, while very effective in the short term, only affects inflation in the medium and long term', 'It is, in other words, neutral', 'Today, new models and advanced computational techniques allow us to simulate the effects of inflation on incentives to save and to work, on the formation of physical capital, and therefore on the prospects for growth', 'The correlation has become negative: higher inflation reduces growth and employment', 'For example, vector autoregressive models with non-constant parameters allow the identification of a range of values \\u200b\\u200bthat quantify the cost in terms of growth failure for every two percentage point increase in steady-state inflation', 'This cost implies lower growth of between 3 and 5 percentage points over a period of ten years', 'Finally, monetary policy is a powerful tool', 'When used improperly, it may cause permanent damage', 'But it can become an effective, stabilising factor and contribute to collective prosperity in an independent and active way', 'The sine qua non for this is to build monetary policy decisions into a systematic and predictable strategy, based on price stability, which drives expectations and guides the economy but doesn’t shock it', 'This is perhaps the most important practical difference to what was studied in the early 1970s', 'The ECB’s monetary policy strategy The ECB’s monetary policy strategy is based on the new theory of the instruments I have tried to outline, and takes into account the enrichment of the theory of objectives, which emphasises the contributions of price stability to the “general prosperity”', 'It also provides continuity for a monetary tradition in continental Europe that has ensured inflation-free growth for more than 60 years', 'The strategy is based on the objective of “ maintaining price stability” that the Treaty has entrusted to the central bank and the quantitative definition that the Governing Council subsequently gave the objective', 'The studies I have mentioned helped to define a range within which inflation is no longer a factor that distorts economic choices', 'The ECB pursues, as an objective of monetary stability in the medium term, an inflation rate below, but close to, 2%, which is the upper limit of this range', 'The macroeconomic model on which the ECB’s monetary policy strategy rests is imbued with contemporary macroeconomics, based on dynamic optimisation and on the centrality of forward-looking expectations', '[5] At the same time, the model is broader and well structured and corrects the simplifications of the pre-crisis neo-Keynesian paradigm with its prescriptive approach to optimal monetary policy', 'The weakness of this paradigm was, and is, its inability to recognise the importance of financial frictions and the role of credit and money', 'This has to do with the fragility of the theoretical foundations that formalise the links between the real economy, financial imbalances and the level of confidence', 'Ignoring money is tantamount to assuming an absence of risk and uncertainty', 'Without risk, Keynes would have said, there would be no money', 'The preference for liquidity is not justified in an economy without uncertainty', 'But the neo-Keynesian model excludes the possibility of default', 'In it, risks in the financial sector can be isolated and therefore have no effect on the real economy', 'The financial crisis has clearly highlighted the weaknesses of this system', 'Macroeconomic theory has begun to reflect on the neo-Keynesian system and these studies are now one of the liveliest areas of analysis', 'These studies – at least their early results – confirm the farsightedness of some of strategic choices of the ECB', 'Liquidity, money, credit have always been – since 1998, when the Bank received its mandate from the founders of the monetary union – qualifying variables of the ECB’s reference model and its strategy', 'The monetary analysis requires a constant monitoring of banks’ assets and liabilities as sources of information on the assessment of risk in the markets and the economy as a whole', 'This analysis commits the Governing Council to adjust the tenor of monetary policy to ensure the long-term growth of monetary aggregates and credit consistent with the potential for economic expansion', 'In this sense, the monetary pillar of the strategy can be interpreted as a strategic reinforcement that helps to prepare correction mechanisms in situations where macroeconomic imbalances are having difficulty in manifesting themselves in inflationary pressures', 'The monetary analysis gave important warning signals in the years preceding the crisis regarding the existence of deep macroeconomic and financial imbalances', 'In the autumn of 2005, in conditions of inflation observed and projected to be “normal”, the ECB’s monetary analysis began to record a change in the composition of M3 growth: from a model of growth explained by money demand factors – that we would define as irrelevant to the evolution of spending and prices – to a dynamic associated with increased credit creation – that is, to banks’ money supply factors', 'These changes were accepted as indications that the tenor of monetary policy, despite the moderation of inflationary pressures observed and projected, had become too lax', 'A new cycle of monetary policy tightening was initiated in December of that year, based on considerations inspired by the monetary pillar, where monetary and financial stability is an intermediate objective for attaining a more balanced development of macroeconomic variables and hence price stability over the long term', 'In a globalised world, the international financial crisis has not spared the euro area', 'But today we know that preventive action by the ECB, implemented mainly by considering monetary indicators, has mitigated the impact on incomes and inflation', '[6]   The two operations of three-year refinancing (LTROs) The monetary analysis has also been an essential strategic tool in diagnosing and managing the crisis', 'In this regard, the analysis that led to the more recent non-standard monetary policy measures can illustrate how the systematic monitoring of banks’ liabilities – money in its broadest sense – can provide guidance on the risks faced by the economy as a whole', 'Towards the end of 2011, with a decision unprecedented in the history of the euro, the ECB’s Governing Council decided to conduct two three-year refinancing operations', 'At the end of February, or when the second three-year operation was completed, the net increase in loans granted to counterparties was around €520 billion', 'The motivation for the two operations can be summarised by the following strategic view', 'A central bank is mandated with the crucial task of ensuring the sufficient supply of liquidity to sound bank counterparties in return for adequate collateral', 'In normal times, “sufficient liquidity” means a volume of refinancing in line with the need for banks to meet the obligatory reserve requirements and the financing of other independent factors which explain the growth over time in the demand for money', 'In times of increased financial instability, “sufficient liquidity” indicates a volume of available central bank money which avoids the risk that – under such market conditions – the temporary inability of banks to provide refinancing leads to insolvency and thus to a situation of widespread default', 'In neither of the two cases – normal times or crisis periods – can the central bank be considered responsible for the survival of bank counterparties that are close to bankruptcy', 'The two long-term refinancing operations achieved the purpose for which they were intended', 'In an environment of a near-shutdown of private credit markets, banks were not able to refinance their assets and were unable to maintain their level of exposure to households and businesses', 'The extensive long-term refinancing allowed for the partial and temporary substitution of private credit with central bank money and thus avoided a disorderly process of credit to the economy running dry', 'Nevertheless, these operations were not without their criticism', 'These can be summarised in three points:   The growth in liquidity following the two operations will ultimately lead to inflation;   The Eurosystem’s balance sheet is exposed to unprecedented and uncontrollable risks;   Such operations have reinforced the perverse link between banks and sovereign debtors and may be considered a violation of the prohibition of financing public debt with central bank money, laid down in Article 123 of the Treaty', 'And, the opposite – but conceptually equivalent – criticism that these operations did not provide the economy with finance', 'As regards the first point, it is again pertinent to refer to strategy: in the medium to long term, the inflation dynamic reflects developments in broader monetary aggregates', 'Conditions that encourage the creation of inflation or speculative bubbles are generated by strong and sustained growth in money and credit, not necessarily as a result of an increase in liquidity granted by the central bank to the banking sector', 'This liquidity constitutes a precautionary supply for sight liabilities that the banks have towards households, non-financial corporations and other banks', 'The sight liabilities, i', 'e', 'deposits, and not the supply of liquidity, demonstrate a high statistical correlation to the price dynamics of goods and assets', 'Today, monetary developments do not allow for the identification of risks of inflation or pressure on asset prices in the medium term', 'As regards the second point, the main criticism related principally to the expansion of collateral accepted by the national central banks of the Eurosystem as a guarantee in return for liquidity extended to credit institutions', 'In particular, doubts were raised regarding credit claims that became eligible with the decisions taken in December 2011', 'These doubts are founded on an incorrect understanding of the guarantees that are requested by the national central banks to protect against the risk that central bank liquidity is not repaid', 'In particular, the discount applied to the nominal value of credit claims provided as security in refinancing operations is very high', 'This means that, for credit claims deposited as collateral with a nominal value of €100, the national central banks accepting the new collateral provide, on average, the equivalent of around €47 in liquidity', 'This discounting represents a powerful method for absorbing the credit risk involved in such operations', 'It is also worth highlighting the fact that the main elements of risk control continue to be shared by the Eurosystem: the criteria for acceptance and measures for controlling risk are approved by the Governing Council, which is also responsible for the continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of all of the measures for mitigating risk', 'With regard to the third point, it is undeniable that, in some countries in particular (especially Spain and Italy), banks used some of the liquidity acquired via the three-year long-term refinancing operations for temporary investments in government bonds', 'Today, central banks do not have an instrument for the precise and targeted allocation of credit to a sector or in favour of a specific financial use', 'Those who accuse the ECB of an indirect violation of the prohibition on financing public debt with central bank money are making the same conceptual mistake as those who accuse the ECB of not having forced the banks to the use the funds acquired via the LTROs to supply credit to the private sector', 'In the first case, banks would have had to have been forced not to purchase government securities, and in the second case, to give credit to the private sector', 'Both groups of accusers forget that the policy of precise allocation of credit was a norm in various countries until the end of the 1970s', 'In the 1980s the operational system for monetary policy was radically redefined, principally on account of the heavily distorting effects of such an operational framework on economic activity', 'Moreover, legal arguments relating to the Treaty and to the current contractual form of repos underlying the LTROs, as well as considerations relating to feasibility, would make it difficult to reinstate such a framework', 'Finally, the behaviour of credit institutions with respect to households and businesses is not uniform across countries: while some countries saw negative credit developments, others saw growth in credit, in some cases even significant growth', 'In Italy, but also in the vast majority of euro area countries, the fall in loans recorded in December has come to a halt, avoiding a much more severe risk of credit restriction which would have had far more serious consequences for growth and monetary stability than the ones we are seeing currently', 'The Bank Lending Survey registered a gradual normalisation of interest rates set by banks and of the criteria for granting loans to companies', 'The continued anaemic developments in lending reflect the weakness in demand and the worsening of creditworthiness resulting from an adverse economic cycle', 'Furthermore, in the countries most adversely affected by the crisis, banks are rationing credit on account of certain prevalent contractual structures', 'The large-scale participation in the February operation, in which around 800 banks obtained funding, and the composition of counterparties in terms of their size and type implies that the distribution of liquidity has been widespread and could be even more so in the near future', 'Furthermore, this widespread distribution of liquidity is also of advantage to small and medium-sized enterprises with which smaller banks have closer relationships', 'We would wish for the liquidity provided to end up as credit to the private sector', 'This is the motivation behind the new non-standard monetary policy instrument', 'Central bank credit to banks has been a complement to – rather than a substitute for – private credit: in the first quarter of this year, the amount of bonds issued was equal to the total issued in 2011 as a whole, which shows that the operations, at least in the first few months of the year, provided the markets with liquidity, reactivating a number of credit channels', 'The two LTROs removed one of the obstacles – the only one over which the ECB has any influence – to credit, namely a lack of liquidity', 'The ECB cannot do anything to make up for a lack of capital, to change intermediaries’ risk perceptions, or to remove other structural obstacles present at national level', 'More generally, the size and complexity of the two LTROs is such that it will take time for all of their positive effects on the euro area economy to be fully felt', 'However, it is essential for growth and employment that credit institutions regain their ability to provide refinancing to the economy', '[1]Tiberi, M', ', “Ricordo di Federico Caffè”, in Rivista italiana degli economisti, April 1997, p', '132', '[2]Caffè, F', ',

President of the European Central Bank with whom I had the privilege to work in the initial stages of the launch of the euro as a member of the Governing Council', 'My presence here today is also a simple gesture to render my homage to his memory as a great contributor to the European ideal', 'I would like to focus my remarks on the underlying reasons for the decision to set-up a Single Supervisory Mechanism as a major step towards a European banking union that was taken at the European Summit in June 2012', 'What is the meaning of a Banking Union', 'In my view it involves a transfer to the European level of the regulatory and institutional framework responsible for safeguarding the robustness and stability of the banking sector', 'The first pillar is regulation', 'It is already largely at the European Union level, particularly with the concept introduced by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa of the “single rulebook” for the 27 Member States, which is based on the principle of maximum harmonization coupled with a wider use of directly applicable regulations', 'Accordingly, what is now at stake in forming a Banking Union goes much further', 'It implies also achieving a European dimension for the main components of the institutional framework for implementing, monitoring and enforcing regulation, both in normal times and in situations of stress', 'According to theory and historical experience, this includes: Bank Supervision, Bank Resolution and Bank Deposit Insurance', 'These are precisely the components of the Integrated Financial Framework that has been presented to the June European Council by President Van Rompuy in his Report “Towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union\"', 'I would like to be clear that I refer to providing a European dimension to the institutional framework and not to a centralization of the competences pertaining to a Banking Union', 'Even a fully federal system implies, by nature, decentralization of tasks between the federal and the lower levels', 'In Europe, subsidiarity and proportionality are key constitutional principles in the exercise of European competences, which are particularly crucial for a well-functioning Banking Union', 'The June Euro Area Summit initiated the construction of a Banking Union with the agreement on the establishment of a Single Supervisory Mechanism, with the involvement of the ECB', 'The reference to the ECB and the statement that the Commission will “bring forward proposals under Article 127 (6) of the Treaty” mean that there is a direct link to EMU', 'As it is well known, Article 127(6) provides that the Council by unanimous vote may “confer specific tasks upon the European Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions', '” Accordingly, the single supervision will refer mainly to the euro area as the ECB can only have binding powers in relation to the 17 members that have adopted the euro', 'The focus on EMU is appropriate for several reasons, which I will elaborate in my remarks', 'However, this does not exclude possible mechanisms for other EU countries to be involved in the single supervisory mechanism, if so foreseen in the Council Regulation activating Article 127', '6 of the Treaty', 'This could facilitate further financial integration in the single market as a whole', 'The Statement of the June Euro Area Summit also makes clear that the single supervisory mechanism is directly related to the decision to grant the possibility of direct recapitalization of banks by the European Stability Mechanism', 'This new and important step in the effort to de-link the vulnerabilities of sovereigns from euro area banks implies an allocation of supervisory functions to the European level', 'Therefore, European recapitalization creates an immediate need for European banking supervision', 'Later in this talk, I will argue why I think that there are very good reasons for the involvement of central banks in the supervision of banks', 'It is essential that both of these elements – recapitalization and supervision on the European level - are implemented as expediently as possible', '2', 'Why the single monetary policy needs a Banking Union  The decisions taken at the June Euro Area Summit are part of the long term reflections on the future of the Monetary Union, which are addressed by President Van Rompuy Report', 'They are also clearly motivated by the challenges that we face in addressing the ongoing crisis', 'The recognition of the negative effects of the feedback loop between banks and sovereigns led to the decision to admit direct European bank recapitalization by the ESM', 'This, in turn, motivated the decision to create a single supervisory mechanism', 'The deeper rationale is however the need to construct a Banking Union for ensuring a successful and well-functioning Monetary Union', 'Let me highlight the following arguments supporting this concept', 'First, a single supervisory mechanism is necessary because of the increasing interconnectedness between financial institutions and markets across the euro area over the past decade, be it through internationally active banking groups, bilateral trading exposures, or presence in the same market segments', 'The recent financial crisis demonstrated how quickly and powerfully problems in the financial sector of one country can spread to another', 'This is especially the case in a monetary union', 'As a result, problems in the banking sector might originate at the national level, but are more and more likely to affect other countries of the euro area as well, and may quickly threaten the stability of the entire euro area banking system', 'Such developments and the underlying financial structures can best be assessed by a central authority rather than through cooperation between national ones', '[1]  Seen from another perspective, the high degree of interconnectedness affects the impact of supervision and other national policies not only on the domestic banking sector, but also, as an externality, on other countries', 'This has been captured by the so-called ‘financial trilemma’', 'The concept of the trilemma is adapted from the famous ’monetary trilemma’ on the impossibility of simultaneously achieving three objectives: a fixed exchange rate, capital mobility, and national monetary policy', '[2] In a very similar way, but applied to international finance, as put forward by Dirk Schoenmaker (2011) following a model by Xavier Freixas (2003) [3]a ‘financial trilemma’ has been defined, which illustrates the impossibility of achieving three objectives in an environment with globalized financial markets', 'These objectives are: first, financial stability; second, financial integration; and third, maintaining national financial policies', '[Slide 1: The financial trilemma] (The complete set of slides is available for download on the right hand side, at the top', ')  According to the financial trilemma, it is not possible to achieve all three objectives at the same time', 'The reasoning behind is that with increasing financial integration, pursuing national financial policies will generally not lead to financial stability, because national policies seek to benefit national welfare, while not taking into account externalities of their supervisory practices on other countries', '[4] This leads to an under-provision of financial stability as a public good', '[5] A lesson of the trilemma is that it is beneficial for the provision of financial stability to replace national policies with policies at the supranational level, thus geographically aligning supervisory incentives with the effect such supervision has on the financial sector as a whole', 'Second, the events of the past few years have demonstrated that Monetary Union in Europe requires a high degree of financial integration, in which financial institutions diversify their assets and liabilities across euro area countries', 'This is essential for an effective transmission of monetary policy', 'Until the start of the financial crisis and in particular until the beginning of the sovereign debt crisis, there was good progress in all aspects of financial integration', 'Unfortunately since then we have been facing a continuous development in the opposite direction with fragmentation of markets along national borders', 'Even more than that, we observe a reversal of flows with capital going to core countries and away from the periphery', 'One example of very quick initial integration was the euro area money market which nevertheless has shown recently a much higher dispersion of rates, reduced cross border volumes with a virtual stop to peripheral countries', 'Chart 2 illustrates how quickly and profoundly interest rates in the short-term money market converged after 1999 and how the dispersion exploded following the crisis', '[Slide 2: Convergence and fragmentation of money market rates] Money markets trade an extremely homogeneous good – central bank money –, and the changes made to the infrastructure (payment systems) were sufficient to establish a unified market with a single price', 'In other market segments, prices somewhat converged, but not fully', 'We are all aware how an exaggerated initial convergence of sovereign bonds yields changed into an abnormal dispersion', '[Slide 3: Evolution of sovereign bond yields] Also, remuneration of bank deposits or interest rates paid on corporate loans for instance, started to diverge markedly across countries', 'At the same time, banks have started to reverse the diversification of their portfolio across borders in recent years, especially in detriment of stressed countries', '[Slide 4: Cross border credit exposures and cross-border share of assets] In general, the crisis led to more disintegration', 'This can be seen for instance in the right hand chart, which illustrates the importance of foreign bank subsidiaries and branches in the total assets of the banking sector: there was a steep increase in integration in the first years of the euro, but after the Lehmann failure, integration declined consistently', 'Imperfect financial integration in a currency union of course complicates the task of the central bank in a very direct way: it becomes more difficult to achieve similar impact in the transmission of monetary policy and to ensure uniform levels of interest rates across countries', 'Thus, the tendency towards less financial integration has unwanted effects also for the conduct of our monetary policy', 'It is essential to reverse this fragmentation and restore the proper transmission mechanism of monetary policy', 'This does not imply that we should eliminate or artificially reduce the spreads of debt instruments across countries that are justified by pure credit risk', 'However it is certainly within the remit of monetary policy to intervene to mitigate risk premia that are related with fears of a break-up of the euro area and have been identified in several analysis [6]', 'This provides the rationale for the new programme of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) that we announced yesterday', 'A necessary condition for OMT is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) programme', 'The joint work of conditionality and bond market interventions can achieve, we hope, the elimination of the tail risk linked with a break-up fear that has been pervasive in the aggravation of the sovereign debt crisis', 'Besides supporting an effective monetary policy, a Banking Union - comprising single banking supervision, common resolution schemes, and a unified deposit insurance - would further foster further the integration of the single financial market', 'It is my conviction that these elements would not only support the conduct of the single monetary policy, but also significantly contribute to breaking the home-bias in banking activity and to allowing banks to further diversify their portfolios across the euro area', 'Last but not least, a Banking Union will also contribute to the vital delinking of sovereigns and banks that has been so detrimental during the crisis', 'The third reason why a Banking Union is beneficial to a Monetary Union is that the natural bias of national supervision, both in lender and borrowing countries, allowed the creation of large macro imbalances in several segments of the euro area', 'Indeed, a major lesson of the crisis is that financial supervision lagged behind financial integration and this contributed to the build-up of macroeconomics imbalances', 'Let me illustrate this with a few numbers', '[Slide 5: Evolution of public debt levels] This chart shows the evolution of public debt levels since the inception of the euro in 1999 of a few selected euro area countries', 'As it can be seen, and perhaps contrary to public perception, overall government debt levels went down in the first years of Monetary Union, that is, in the period 1999 until 2007, by around 5', '6%', 'Notably, we can see significant reductions in Italy (-14', '8%), Spain (-35', '3%), and Ireland (-10%)', 'The resulting debt levels of several countries were still high in 2007, and in two cases far above 60%', 'Still, it cannot have been the overall increase of public debt alone that led to the eruption macroeconomic imbalances', 'It was the crisis, as can be seen from the chart that led to sharp increases of public debt across all countries only after 2008', 'The dangerous feedback effects between the state of sovereigns and their local banking systems emerged only after the start of the financial crisis', 'It operated in both directions: either the support of banks overburdened the sovereign or the sovereign weakness led the domestic banks to take on more recently a higher share of national public debt', 'This is seen in the following chart that shows the pattern of domestic banks´ holdings of national debt going down until 2009 and then increasing afterwards', '[Slide 6: Public debt held by domestic banks] An aside aspect shown by the chart is that public debt was not taken predominantly by the domestic banking sectors until 2009 as the domestic share declined until then, indicating the progress of financial integration across member States during many years', 'To understand what happened in the run up to the crisis it should be highlighted that until 2007 the evolution of public debt in the countries now under stress was financed mostly by external investors and not by resident financial institutions', \"Another aspect that is sometimes also ignored refers to the fact that the banks' portfolio of domestic public debt is not very high in percentage of total bank assets and even now is generally below the historical average\", '[Slide 7: Public debt held by domestic banks in % of Total Assets] The points I just made seem to run counter to the idea that the macro imbalances in peripheral countries was mostly driven by the public sector', 'As seen in the charts, with the possible exception of Greece, that seems not to have been the case', 'I will show in a moment that the imbalances came mostly from the private sector expenditure behaviour laxly financed by the financial sector', 'This fact is in turn connected with another major lesson of the crisis that reveals also a shortcoming in the initial design of the monetary union: the notion that it was enough to discipline public finance, through the Stability and Growth Pact, to avoid major imbalances in the euro area', 'This mistake is surely related to two features of the dominant economic thinking at the time:  - first that the private sector is essentially stable and self-correcting composed of fully rational agents always optimizing inter-temporally with knowledge of the future probability distributions to infinity of economic returns and variables', 'In such a world no defaults are admitted or dangerous bubbles possible', 'Only the public sector can create instability', '- second, that finance does not matter for real economy fluctuations', 'After the Real Business Cycles school, the rational expectations hypothesis and the intertemporal optimization paradigm, money and finance were considered not relevant anymore', 'Later, in the new Keynesian consensual macro model money crept back in through the introduction of wage and price rigidities, allowing for short-term real economy effects of monetary policy', 'On the contrary, finance became invisible with the Efficient Market Hypothesis ensuring a reliable plumbing as servant of the real economy', 'Banks and their credit activity and capital markets and their financing were not considered significant sources of instabilities with real economy effects', 'They were absent from macroeconomic models', 'This vision about the way the economic was supposed to work was discredited with the crisis but surely influenced the initial concept that it was enough to discipline the public sector', 'We know that in the end the SGP did not ensure that discipline and some countries deviated from prudent fiscal policy', 'Nevertheless, what was more relevant to explain the macro imbalances relates to the explosion of private debt in the peripheral countries financed by domestic banks which were themselves mostly funded by other European financial institutions and markets', '[Slide 8: Public and Private debt] Contrary to public debt levels, the overall level of private debt increased in the first seven years of Monetary Union by 14 percentage points or 27%', 'The increase was much more pronounced in Greece (+217%), Ireland (+101%), Spain (+ 75', '2%), and Portugal (+49%), all of which are countries that have been severely under pressure during the recent crisis', 'Another illustration of the role played by private indebtedness is provided by an analysis of the evolution of the financial balances (savings- investment) of the different economic sectors including the external one', '[Slide 9: Financial balances by sector] The Chart shows how in Spain, Ireland and Portugal it was the increase in the deficit of non-financial firms until the onset of the crisis that contributed, in turn, to the increase of the external deficit, whereas in Greece the public deficit had a bigger influence', 'The willingness of banks, domestic and foreign, to fund private agents was essential for the creation of the large macroeconomic imbalances and the housing price bubbles that we have witnessed', 'These were fuelled by excessive credit growth', 'This also implies that supervisors, at least in some areas, appeared to have been overly lenient with the banking sector', 'To some extent, this is due to the promotion of national champions and the objective of supporting the local banking system', 'Some empirical support for this line of argumentation comes from the US', 'A recent study shows, for the US, that local supervisors tend to be more lenient with banks than federal supervisors are: they downgrade less frequently', '[7] The authors justify this behaviour, among other factors, by regulatory capture', 'And indeed, there is no reason to believe that these findings would be any different for other industrialized countries, including the euro area', 'Therefore, following this argumentation, placing supervision at the European level would help to alleviate national bias and possible regulatory capture', '3', 'The ECB’s involvement in a Banking Union There are good reasons developed in the academic literature for allocating the task of banking supervision either to the central bank or to a separate supervisory authority', 'Some of these arguments have already been put forward in a 2001 paper of the ECB, which concluded that national central banks should have a fundamental role in prudential supervision in the euro area', '[8]  Let me turn first to the benefits of allocating supervisory powers to the central bank', 'A first argument why the combination of both supervision and monetary policy under one roof is beneficial results from the fact that being responsible for monetary policy creates for the central bank an intrinsic and deep interest in a stable financial system', 'Such stability can be jeopardized through the failure or break-up of an individual financial institution', 'If a banking failure occurs, the financial system might be destabilized through contagion which could arise through several possible channels: one such channel could be through bilateral exposures to the failing institutions', 'Other channels could be related to informational contagion such as uncertainty about such bilateral exposures, or uncertainty about the nature of the shock that hit the institution', 'Moreover, those direct channels might be amplified if resolution mechanisms are complex, lengthy or surrounded by too much uncertainty', 'A central bank has an interest in avoiding the risk of such a destabilizing situation because of its mandate for price stability: since the transmission of its monetary policy relies in the first instance on the smooth functioning of the money markets', 'Money markets are, however, one of the first markets to be affected if there are doubts about the solvency of an institution', 'This was clearly witnessed in August 2007, when the emergence of first doubts about the exposure of individual European banks to the US sub-prime mortgage market led to a temporary standstill of that market', '[9]     Second, there is a close relationship between micro-prudential control of individual financial institutions and the assessment of risks to the overall financial system, which constitutes the central bank’s macro-prudential responsibility', 'Even in those countries where the central bank is not involved in individual bank supervision, the central bank’s responsibility for systemic stability is unchallenged', 'This is one reason why the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that was established in 2010 with a mandate for macro-prudential oversight, is chaired by a central banker (the President of the ECB)', 'The assessment of systemic risk would quite naturally be facilitated if supervisory information about individual institutions was used', 'Further information-related synergies exist between the supervision of banks and the oversight of payment systems, which is a task usually allocated to the central bank', 'The ECB, for instance, is responsible for the oversight of all large-value payment systems operating in the euro area', 'Moreover, it is the owner of the largest of those systems, the TARGET2 system', 'Fourth, central banks have a lot of expertise on the financial sector, because of their role in monetary policy and oversight as well as their general interest in financial stability', 'These roles imply a constant monitoring of different segments of the financial market in order to assess the transmission of monetary policy impulses, regular interactions with counterparts to their monetary operations, and operational and oversight activities in large-value payment systems', 'Such knowledge is likely to be crucial in situations of financial stress, and enables central banks to be able to assess such situations more quickly and profoundly than other institutions with different mandates and functions', 'Thus, if a central bank were entrusted with supervisory powers, it would be able to react relatively quickly in case of an imminent banking failure', '[10] This ability would be particularly relevant in financial crisis times, in which a number of institutions would be on the brink at the same time, but in which there is great uncertainty about the depth and impact of the crisis in general, and about individual banks’ solvency in particular', 'Such a situation would require particularly careful monitoring and expertise, which the central bank is in a relatively good position to deliver', 'I would like to stress that also in the case that the organizational structure of the central bank was such that the tasks of monetary policy and supervision were operationally strictly separated, the transfer of such knowledge about the state of different financial market segments could be institutionalized quite easily', 'A fifth argument is that the operational independence of the supervisory agency is important for effective supervision', 'Here, I refer to independence from political interference, and I have in mind situations in which local politics may have an interest in the avoiding bank resolutions for political reasons', 'This independence would be emphasized by allocating the supervisory responsibility to the central bank', 'Let me now turn to arguments about potential downsides of having central bank involvement in banking supervision', 'The following arguments have been made in the literature:    First, there is the issue of reputation risk of the central bank (an argument brought forward by Charles Goodhart) [11]: the monetary policy function of the central bank requires that it maintains a high level of credibility and reputation, since it is essential to keep expectations of rising inflation at bay', 'According to this argument, if the central bank is in charge not only of price stability but also of banking supervision, poor supervisory performance (in particular, the occurrence of banking failures with notable economic consequences) would damage the reputation of the supervisor, and this may damage also the central bank’s reputation as a competent monetary authority', 'This could endanger price stability, the central bank’s main concern', 'In my view, this risk is overemphasized', 'The tasks of maintaining price stability and of supervising banks are very different in nature, and their results are easily measurable and distinguishable', 'If a central bank has a record of having achieved price stability over a longer period of time, then instability in the banking sector might complicate its price stability mandate, but it would not create doubts about its commitment to further pursue this task', 'I am fully convinced that the public will be able to distinguish between the two functions, and that repercussions from the reputation gained in one or the other function would be minimal', 'A second argument against allocating supervisory powers at the central bank concerns possible conflicts of interest between the different central bank functions', 'At the heart of this argumentation is the question whether the central banks’ concern for the health of banks would jeopardize its price stability objective', 'It could do so for instance by creating an environment of low interest rates with the aim of supporting the banking sector’s health, or by using its capabilities for money creation to support individual banks', 'However, is it really conceivable that a central bank that is in charge of banking supervision takes these routes', 'To me, the solution to these concerns lies in the organizational structure of the central bank', 'A situation, in which the central bank puts at risk price stability in favour of financial stability, is not conceivable if the central bank is given a clear hierarchical mandate that places price stability before other concerns', 'Internal procedures can be, and should be, designed in a way that this is efficiently implemented', 'Of course, central banks may in crisis times be involved in lender-of-last-resort functions', 'But they might take on this role regardless of whether they have a supervisory mandate or not', 'And I should emphasize that such forms of liquidity support would in any case be very limited both in its frequency – central banks should take on this role only in case of a severe financial crisis – as well in duration', 'These limitations, connected with a recessionary situation, ensure that extended liquidity support would have no inflationary impact', 'In practice, the allocation of supervisory responsibilities is handled very differently across countries, even within the euro area', 'At present, a majority of euro area central banks, that is, 12 out of 17 National Central Banks have full supervisory powers while 2 others are also involved in supervisory tasks', 'Around a decade ago, the situation was quite different, and there was a tendency towards separation of the two functions', 'The recent trend, however, points towards combining both functions under one roof', 'This trend reversal can be observed also outside the euro area', 'For instance, in the UK, the FSA was founded in the late 1990s, but recent proposals aim at re-allocating it under the umbrella of the Bank of England', 'In the US, the FED was also given an extension of its mandate regarding supervision', 'Indeed, the experience during the financial and sovereign debt crises has demonstrated the benefits of including banking supervision under the central bank’s purview', '4', 'Elements of a Banking Union All the arguments I summed up above support the notion of having a supra-national, euro area wide supervisory authority', '[12] As I have argued, this would be beneficial in order to foster further financial integration, to deal with the high degree of connectivity between financial sectors across borders, and would break the close link between banks and their sovereigns', 'The precise set-up of the future supervisory arrangements is still to be decided', 'Let me express my personal views on the main principles that should guide such arrangements in order to achieve the objectives that I have outlined', 'First, it is crucial to ensure that there are no loopholes of supervisory responsibilities', 'The euro area supervision should be conferred with a complete set of tasks and responsibilities, in a clear and unambiguous manner', 'Second, as I mentioned at the beginning of this talk, supervision should be conducted in line with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality', 'This implies that the operational conduct of supervisory tasks should be decentralized to the largest extent with national supervisors', 'Ideally, the single supervisory mechanism will consist of a network comprising the ECB and national supervisors', \"Third, supervision should encompass all euro area banks in a way that the home/host distinction will cease to exist in the euro area, where all banks will become 'domestic', equally subject to euro area supervision\", 'This is essential from a supervisory and financial stability perspective, as well as to preserve the level-playing field among banks', 'The fact that the ECB would have ultimate legal responsibility does not imply that all banks will be supervised from Frankfurt and that the ECB will have to hire an army of supervisors', 'The degree of intensity of supervision at the centre will be closely related to the systemic relevance of banks', 'In this framework, the ECB would be closely supervising only the significant cross-border banking groups', 'Local supervisors, operating under the umbrella, guidance and monitoring of the ECB, would conduct the supervision of the overwhelming majority of credit institutions', 'Crucially though, the ECB would maintain, the ultimate legal responsibility, which would include the right to exercise at any moment a closer supervision of any institution or group of institutions if it finds it appropriate', 'This approach would ensure the harmonization and the level playing field in the implementation of the single supervisory mechanism and will be enough to overcome any inefficient national bias in conducting bank supervision', 'Fourth, as I also argued already, there should a clear organizational separation between monetary policy and supervision', 'This can be realized at all organizational layers, from the analytical and informational level to the decision-making level', 'In a recent interview Commissioner Barnier referred that the Commission´s proposal includes the creation of Supervisory Board in the ECB which goes in the right direction', 'Fifth, euro area supervision should be conducted in independence, in line with the Basel Core Principles, and also be subject to high standards of democratic accountability to ensure confidence in the conduct of this public function in the euro area', 'Sixth, the single supervisory mechanism should contribute to the deepening and reinforcement of the single financial market', 'This implies that the role of the EBA should be fully safeguarded as regulator and as the entity responsible for monitoring the implementation of the “single rulebook” by all supervisors', 'The euro area supervisory jurisdiction will need to be matched by two further institutional evolutions', 'The first of these is the move towards a unified bank resolution scheme', 'Quite naturally, this is an integral element of the banking union, which must have a resolution authority to close or restructure banks whenever appropriate', 'Again, it is not sufficient that banks operate in an environment only with somewhat harmonized rules about bank resolution', 'It is necessary that there is a unified legal framework that clearly and unequivocally specifies rules and procedures in case of a bank resolution', 'An effective euro area wide resolution scheme would be an essential element of a Banking Union because it would be able to deal with large and complex banking groups', 'Indeed, banks and banking groups have continuously grown over the past decades', 'Reasons are mainly returns to scale in the banking industry which make larger banks more efficient than smaller ones, but also a tendency of national governments to promote and protect national champions', 'In some cases, banks have grown so much that their failure would, on the one hand, endanger the financial system of several countries at the same time, but on the other hand, be too large for the national government of the home country to be supported in case of stress [13] and thereby causing or exacerbate funding problems of the sovereign, which might further destabilize the banking sector [14]', 'For both reasons, a euro area wide resolution authority would be very beneficial', 'This Resolution Authority should be totally separated from the Supervisor and would be merged in the future with deposit insurance into an European Deposit Insurance and Resolution Authority (EDIRA) similar to the FDIC in the US', 'Of course, it is essential that such an authority has sufficient power and resources in order to deal with widespread instability in the banking sector', 'The problems with cross-border banks are indeed quite complex', 'The resolution case of Fortis in 2008, a Belgian/Dutch financial conglomerate with substantial subsidiaries in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, illustrates the tension between the cross-border nature of a group and the domestic focus of national legal frameworks and responsibilities for crisis management', 'To start with, there were no bank resolution frameworks in place in the Netherlands and Belgium, which would have provided the authorities with resolution powers and tools to resolve individual banks in a manner that maintains financial stability in urgent situations, overriding the rights of shareholders', 'This severely limited the options for the authorities', 'In addition, the supervisory authorities assessed the situation differently despite having a long-standing relationship in ongoing supervision and information sharing', 'The differences in the assessment of available information and the sense of urgency complicated the finalization of the whole process', 'The precise design of a bank resolution scheme is a highly political decision, since it inevitably implies redistributive effects, since stakeholders in different countries can be affected in quite different ways', '[15] I fully agree with the principles laid out in the recent Commission´s proposal with its broad approach about early intervention powers and the general bail-in rules with a precise definition of the pecking order of different type of creditors and depositors', '[16]  I should stress that when I am talking about a resolution scheme, I am not referring to the bailing out of banks with public money', 'Resolution is for institutions that have reached the point of non-viability and includes the sale or merger of the institution or the creation of a bad / good bank with or without a bridge bank or, finally, the orderly liquation of what is really non-viable', 'An effective resolution regime – interacting with applicable scheme and arrangement for the protection of depositors – should ensure the continuity of systemically important financial functions and allocate losses to the shareholders and creditors, and not rely on public solvency support', 'As the experience of the FDIC in the US shows public money may be temporarily necessary but not in relevant amounts', 'This explains why the creation of a European Resolution Authority with a European Resolution Fund on the basis of industry contributions does not depend on the deepening of the fiscal union as some have argued', 'The other element that should complement supervision and bank resolution in a banking union concerns a deposit insurance scheme', 'Such a scheme would have several benefits', 'It would be commensurate to the European supervisory regime, and ensure that decisions that are taken at the supranational level affect depositors in all countries in the same way, thus ensuring a level playing-field: depositors would be treated in a uniform way across countries, independently of their location and the location of the bank they have entrusted their savings to', '[17]  The scheme would thereby also foster financial integration', 'To achieve this, indeed more than a harmonization of local frameworks would be needed, but rather the setting up of a euro area wide deposit protection agency', 'In particular in times of widespread financial instability, deposit insurance payoffs depend not only on the legal framework they are based on, but also on the ability of the deposit insurance fund to cope with large-scale banking failures', 'Doubts on this ability, for instance due to concerns on the fiscal health of the sovereign, could easily reinforce (local) bank runs', 'At the moment, deposit protection schemes in the euro area are still fragmented along national borders', 'While there have been waves of harmonization - for instance in 2009, a uniform minimum coverage of EUR 100,000 was introduced -, they still display significant regional differences', 'From a central bank perspective, the establishment of a common deposit insurance scheme is of less urgency than the other components of a banking union', 'I also understand the concerns with potential liabilities to be incurred in a moment of financial crisis', 'The fact that the rationale of deposit insurance schemes is linked to the few bank failures that may occur and for which the accumulated funds paid in by the sector may be sufficient, it is perhaps not accepted in the present situation on the basis of fears of tail risks which require larger resources', 'This means that its implementation will take more time, even if it is mention in President Van Rompuy Report as a component of a deeper integrated financial sector framework', 'A European deposit insurance scheme is an important element that that should be pursued further, as it will be important to fend off bank runs and thus enhance trust in the European banking sector', 'In my view, the careful design of the different elements of a Banking Union is indispensable for its success', 'It is essential that it creates the right incentives for both bank managers and authorities to contribute to the goal of financial stability, by truthful reporting of facts and effective cooperation between authorities, be they national or European', 'Finally, I regard it as important that in the future such a framework does not apply only to large, internationally active banks, but would universally cover all banks that are operating in the euro area', 'This would be important to establish a level playing field between different types of banks and banking activities, and leave as little room as possible for regulatory arbitrage', '5', 'Conclusions Together, the various elements that integrate the concept of a banking union constitute a solid and consistent framework that will foster financial integration and be supportive of Economic and Monetary Union', 'They would overcome a shortcoming of the initial design of the monetary union that allowed financial supervision to lag behind monetary and financial integration', 'Their implementation will also contribute to address the current crisis by helping to separate banks from the sovereigns and reverse the on-going fragmentation of markets along national borders', 'This in turn will help to restore the proper functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism', 'In particular, the new structure of the supervisory framework would reflect and complement the single market in financial services', 'I regard as normal that the ECB will be given, according to the European Summit decisions, a major role in the supervisory framework', 'It is with an acute sense of responsibility and awareness of the involved risks that I look to the new competences about to be bestowed on the ECB, confident that our Institution will continue to serve well the inspiring goals of our European Union', 'Ladies and Gentlemen, I thank you for your attention', '[1]See, e', 'g',

great depth, Shakespeare's words came to my mind and I thought for a moment he had come to bury me, although he has actually come to praise me\", 'I am afraid that this is the fate of anybody whose retirement comes within sight', 'Nothing but good should be said of the dead, they say', 'Considering that I am still alive, it is even more gratifying to hear nothing but good things about myself; perhaps with the exception of my addiction to tobacco – an addiction that Klaus and I happen to share', 'There is one thing I should like to emphasise in the laudation', 'As Klaus Liebscher has just said, my career has benefited from a \"Summe von Zufälligkeiten\" that I have been lucky enough to encounter throughout my professional life', \"Hard work, clear objectives and a predilection for one's profession are necessary but not always sufficient conditions for success; being in the right place at the right time is likely to provide momentous opportunities that may contribute to making anyone's career more challenging\", \"However, in my reply to Klaus Liebscher's laudation, I should like to leave the past at rest and focus on the future, just as Klaus has done in the second part of his speech\", \"I should particularly like to make a link between Klaus's comments about the importance of stability-oriented macroeconomic policies – to which I fully subscribe – and one of the key challenges the European Union is facing, enlargement, most likely involving ten new member countries\", 'The enlargement of the European Union is a subject that has received much interest in this country in particular, given its proximity to central and eastern Europe', 'Indeed, the accession of ten new countries will now place Austria in the geographical heart of the European Union, although Austria has already been at the heart of the European integration process as such since its own accession to the European Union in 1995', 'In my speech today, I should like to address the importance of stability-oriented and sound macroeconomic policies for the accession countries, particularly now in the run-up to full EU membership', 'Let me briefly elaborate on three aspects which lie at the core of stability-oriented policies in the accession countries: first, the need to enhance central bank independence; second, the importance of fiscal discipline; and, third, the implementation of further structural reforms', 'As regards the first point, most accession countries have modified – or are in the process of modifying – their respective EMU-related legislation to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Treaty', 'However, central bank independence in accession countries should not be seen only as a legal requirement under the acquis communautaire but also as an important impetus to and precondition for policies geared towards monetary stability and nominal convergence with the EU', 'Indeed, if the drafters of the Treaty placed a strong emphasis on central bank independence, it is because of the conviction that the achievement of price stability is best served by an independent institution with a well-defined mandate', \"In line with this approach, the forerunner of the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Monetary Institute (EMI), established a list of parameters of central bank independence, which form the basis for assessing accession country compliance with this requirement by the ECB when evaluating the new Member States' convergence processes\", 'The process of enhancing central bank independence has not been smooth in all accession countries but, overall, it is now well advanced and its benefits are already apparent', 'Indeed, most accession countries have made significant progress in terms of disinflation', 'In 2001, average inflation rates in the region as a whole fell to single figure levels for the first time since the fall of the iron curtain and, thereafter, they have continued to decline', 'In this context, let me highlight that, bearing in mind the potential inflationary pressures that might arise from completing structural reforms, the conduct of a monetary policy in the accession countries aiming at price stability should be seen as a medium-term objective, rather than as a short-term target', 'However, the sound management of macroeconomic policies cannot rely on monetary policy alone', 'In particular, stability-oriented policies in accession countries need to be supported by sound fiscal policies', 'Prudent fiscal policy management has been key to making sustainable progress in terms of macroeconomic stabilisation in the accession countries', \"At the beginning of the transition to a market economy, poor tax collection and governments' limited access to financial markets led to substantial monetisation of public deficits\", 'However, from the mid-1990s onwards, fiscal policy has focused on macroeconomic stability', \"Therefore, a key lesson from the accession countries' experience is that responsible fiscal policy has been a crucial element in achieving and maintaining macroeconomic stability\", 'Looking ahead, the best contribution that fiscal policies can make to sustainable non-inflationary growth is by pressing ahead with fiscal consolidation, as is necessary to ensure the flexibility needed to deal with potential domestic and/or external economic shocks in the medium term', 'Regrettably, fiscal developments have worsened recently in a few accession countries, reflecting ongoing restructuring programmes and higher expenditures related to the adoption of EU standards, but also the lack of a realistic medium-term fiscal strategy', 'In addition, structural deficits have become rather large and public debt ratios have started to increase, limiting the room for manoeuvre of automatic stabilisers', 'Overall, the need for further fiscal consolidation seems overwhelming, as fiscal slippages could put under pressure and even endanger the macroeconomic stabilisation achieved thus far', 'Finally, let me turn briefly to the third component of, or perhaps better complement to, stability-oriented policies in accession countries that I will be addressing today: the implementation of further structural reforms', 'Stability-oriented policies can best be supported by structural reforms, as they enhance the flexibility of the economy to adjust to necessary changes and cope with potential shocks', 'Moreover, structural reforms are also key determinants of the medium-term growth potential', \"In the case of the accession countries, structural reforms are even more important because they are necessary to complete the full adjustment of the accession countries' economies toward well-functioning market economies, including the setting-up of appropriate institutions and the adoption of international best practices in a number of areas\", 'Completing this agenda is a challenge for the accession countries, particularly because of the sheer magnitude of pending reforms', 'Moreover, structural changes may complicate the conduct of monetary policy, as structural reforms may cause structural breaks that complicate the pursuit of credible disinflationary policies', 'Also, the calendar for further price liberalisation, which has an impact on inflationary developments, is often set by each government and is thus difficult for a central bank to predict', 'From an ECB perspective, financial sector reform is also of the utmost importance', 'The reasons for this are mainly twofold', 'First, sound financial sectors are key to delivering \"stable money\"', 'Weak financial systems tend to blur the monetary transmission mechanism and the capacity of monetary policy to influence inflation and growth outcomes, putting the maintenance of price stability and the credibility of the central bank at risk', 'Second, financial sector reform is needed because it ensures that structural reforms, particularly in the goods and labour markets, become fully effective', 'Indeed, despite recent structural reforms and positive growth, the catching-up of per capita income with the euro area has remained limited, and in many countries output growth remains below potential', \"Efficiently functioning financial markets are an important precondition for an efficient allocation of capital, thereby contributing to an economy's growth potential\", 'In many ways, the prospect of EU accession has been instrumental in triggering reform in accession countries, and structural reforms have advanced far enough in these economies to achieve macroeconomic stability', 'However, there is much that remains to be done', 'I am confident that the policy-makers in the region will \"hear and listen\" and remain committed to continuing along the path of reform on which they have already embarked', 'Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, with respect to the enlargement of the EU and, later on, the accession of these countries to the euro area, the next few years will be crucial', 'I will take part in at least most of this process as an observer and no longer as an actor', 'However, I will continue to watch with great interest how the European Union and, in particular, the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) continues to manage this momentous process', 'I should like to conclude by again thanking IMADEC University for the honour it has bestowed upon me', 'I regard this honorary doctorate as a reward not only for myself, but also for all those – and Klaus Liebscher is one of them – who have contributed to a

'Coincidently, Bloomberg was founded in 1981 and so was the ECU, the European currency unit, one of the forefathers of our common currency, the euro', 'So let me take the opportunity, today, to speak about the state of the euro area economy', 'When assessing the euro area economic outlook, three criteria are of particular relevance in the current juncture', 'First, how much does the euro area banking sector still rely on central bank liquidity support measures', 'And second, can we be confident that private sector domestic demand can contribute to a sustained economic recovery', 'And third, what are the implications for price stability against this background', 'In what I will present to you I will argue that there are some good news when assessing these two questions', 'First, money market activity in the euro area improved which has allowed the ECB to withdraw some of the liquidity support', 'Second, household incomes and non-financial corporations’ balance sheets are improving supporting a positive outlook on euro area growth, also against the background of further consolidation efforts of euro area governments', 'And third, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households, also as inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term', 'So let me assess the euro area financial and economic outlook in a bit more detail', 'Part I: Assessing the euro area financial and economic outlook  Reduction of central bank intermediation… The size of refinancing operations has decreased considerably since 30\\xa0June 2010, from €881 billion on that date to €510 billion in mid-November', 'The phasing-out of non-standard measures continued in the third quarter of 2010, and is still continuing in the fourth quarter, as all maturing one-year and six-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) are not being renewed', '… as money markets are improving', 'Conditions in the euro area money markets are improving', 'The volumes in the interbank money market (EONIA) have virtually doubled since summer, and are now back to the levels prevailing before August 2007', 'The overall reduction in central bank liquidity has brought the interbank (EONIA) rate closer to the policy rate, which is an important step towards going back to our pre-crisis framework', 'Euro area activity recovered in the second quarter of 2010… Economic activity in the euro area is recovering', 'According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, GDP grew by 0', '4%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2010, after increasing by 1', '0% in the second quarter', 'While no breakdown is available for the third quarter of 2010, all components contributed positively to quarterly GDP growth in the second quarter', 'In particular, domestic demand contributed quite strongly for the first time since the crisis, namely by 0', '5\\xa0percentage point', '… and surveys point to ongoing growth into the fourth quarter', 'Looking beyond the third quarter, survey indicators, such as the Purchasing Managers’ index (PMI) and European Commission business surveys for the manufacturing and the services sectors, point to ongoing growth in October', 'Consumer confidence increased in October and stood above its long-term average, pointing to a gradual recovery in euro area consumption', 'Good prospects for households’ income from the stabilisation in the labour markets… The sentiment in the survey data finds its support in a number of encouraging developments, both in the household and in the non-financial corporations sector', 'On the household side, labour markets are stabilising, with employment levels remaining stable in the first and the second quarters of 2010, while hours worked increased by 0', '2%, quarter on quarter, in both these quarters', 'The effect of the crisis on hours worked was far stronger than that on the number of persons employed', 'Therefore, the upturn has also been stronger in terms of the hours worked', 'Moreover, the unemployment rate has stabilised in the last few months and stood at 10', '0% in the third quarter of 2010', 'Overall, the stabilisation in the labour markets is creating good prospects for household income and, thereby, also for private consumption', 'Indeed, the breakdown of households’ income shows that the share of compensation of employees has increased recently, while the contribution of net social benefits has declined', '… and upward trend in production and new orders', 'As to non-financial corporations, we can observe an increasing improvement in their conditions', 'Industrial production (excluding construction) and new orders (excluding ships, railway and aerospace equipment) are on a rising trend after the strong decline observed during the crisis', 'Financing conditions are showing signs of improvement… Euro area financing conditions are showing signs of a gradual improvement', 'Short term and long term bank lending rates are currently at very low levels by historical standards supporting a turnaround in the demand for credit', '… supporting the turnaround in the growth of lending to households and non-financial corporations', 'The annual growth of MFI loans to non-financial corporations became less negative in September, confirming that the turnaround in loan dynamics is ongoing', 'The annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations is actually expected to turn positive in the last quarter of 2010', 'Part II: Challenges ahead The crisis has brought to the fore a number challenges for the euro area economy and our common currency, the euro', 'Some of these challenges are new ones, but some are existing ones that were amplified by the crisis developments', 'It is clear that we cannot be complacent against the background of the positive sentiment on the euro area economic outlook', 'We need to ambitiously and urgently address the challenges that we are facing to ensure a continued and sustainable outlook for euro area growth and price stability', 'For this reason we need bold reforms in Europe’s economic governance, particularly with regard to fiscal and macroeconomic policy surveillance', 'Consolidation of public finances… The crisis has caused public finances to deteriorate significantly, not only in the euro area, but throughout the advanced world', 'This can be seen, first and foremost, from the rapid rise in government deficits and debt ratios over a short period of time', 'The budget gaps in the United Kingdom and the United States have actually reached double-digit figures, with Japan coming close as well', 'As regards the euro area, according to the Spring 2010 projections by the European Commission, the government deficit could rise to 6', '6% of GDP this year, before moderating to 6', '1% in 2011', '… and its underlying factors', 'These budgetary developments reflect three main factors', 'The first, is the operation of automatic fiscal stabilisers, i', 'e', 'the reaction to the recession built into the budgets, given the existing social security and tax systems', 'Second, the origins of the fiscal expansion are to be found in the stimulus packages that were a coordinated response to the European Economic Recovery Plan of December 2008 and bank recapitalisation', 'Their cumulative impact was roughly 2', '3% of GDP in 2009-10', 'Third, a number of other factors show up in an expansionary fiscal stance, namely other discretionary measures, unexpected revenue shortfalls (e', 'g', 'losses of income linked to the decline in asset prices) and ongoing spending trends (e', 'g', 'in public wages), even as the trend of nominal GDP growth fell markedly', 'However, against the background of rapidly deteriorating fiscal positions, many euro area countries have started to implement their consolidation plans, which is reflected in the projected decrease in fiscal deficits for the coming year by the European Commission', 'Diverse developments in unit labour costs across countries', 'In the years prior to the crisis, the development of competitiveness diverged significantly across euro area countries', 'Relative price adjustments have thus far been relatively moderate within the euro area, if there have been any at all', 'In fact, unit labour costs in the period 2008-09 have generally increased in deficit countries relative to those in the euro area as a whole', 'Looking forward, such cost adjustment in the period 2010-11 is currently expected to be relatively limited', 'According to European Commission forecasts, only Ireland is expected to experience a significant improvement in its labour costs relative to those in the euro area', 'While the growth of labour costs is also expected to decline in all other deficit countries, it will in many cases remain close to, or even above, the corresponding rate for the euro area as a whole', 'Therefore including competitiveness as an indicator for surveillance at the European level is key and already foreseen in the new EU economic governance framework', 'Reform of the EU’s economic governance framework… European leaders recognize the need of a considerable strengthening of the economic model', 'At their meeting on 28 and 29 October 2010, the EU Heads of State and Government agreed on the reform of the European Union’s economic governance', 'The proposals put forward by President van Rompuy represent a strengthening of the existing framework for fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance in the European Union', 'However, the Governing Council feels that they do not go far enough to be the quantum leap forward in the economic governance of Monetary Union that it has been calling for', '[1]  On the fiscal surveillance, we need an effective surveillance mechanism so that corrective policy action is taken in good time', 'And we need ambitious targets for the reduction of public debt towards the 60% of GDP ceiling', 'On the broader surveillance of macroeconomic policies in the euro area, we need a new system of mutual surveillance in the euro area, concentrating firmly on euro area countries experiencing sustained losses of competitiveness and large current account deficits as these countries face the greatest sustainability challenges', 'It should be determined by transparent and effective trigger mechanisms and specify clearly the sanctions in case of breach', 'And we need full transparency', 'The assessments of macroeconomic imbalances and recommendations for corrective action should be given broad publicity at all stages of the surveillance process', '… with a special focus on financial surveillance', 'And finally, the financial crisis has taught us that economic growth can be severely impacted by financial market disruptions', 'For this reason, European leaders agreed on a new financial supervisory architecture for the EU aiming to prevent financial disruptions of the kind that we have been experiencing in the future', 'This new financial supervisory architecture, which will become operational as of 1\\xa0January 2011, includes the three new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) for banking, insurance and securities markets to enhance micro-prudential supervision and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) as the new macro-prudential supervisory body in the EU', 'The ECB will provide the secretariat to the ESRB', 'The assignment to the ECB of specific tasks concerning the functioning of the ESRB is welcome, but does not constitute a change in the mandate or an additional objective for monetary policy', 'Rather, these tasks should contribute to financial stability, while being fully in line with the ECB’s primary objective of maintaining price stability', 'There are clear lines of institutional separation between the ECB and the ESRB', 'In particular, both institutions are independent and have separate, clearly defined mandates, namely the maintenance of price stability in the case of the ECB and the mitigation of systemic risk in that of the ESRB', '[1]See the ECB proposals on “Reforming economic governance in the euro area”, which President Trichet submitted to the van Rompuy Task Force on behalf of the Governing Council on 15\\xa0June

Conférence de Montréal,30 May 2005, Montreal Mr Prime Minister, Mr Mayor, Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is with great pleasure that I have come to attend the debate and discussion at the international economic forum of the Americas/Montreal conference, and more especially to address you today', 'The issue chosen for the forum this year, “Success at a time of turbulence”, is especially relevant in a world beset by constant economic, financial and technological change', 'So I would like today to share the European experience with you', 'Allow me first of all to discuss the recent development of economic activity in the euro area, the better to underscore the prospects and to describe the challenges to be faced if Europe is to make its own contribution to the growth of a world undergoing in-depth transformation and thus tending to be turbulent', 'The economy of the euro area: a stable macroeconomic situation, but economic dynamism that requires further stimulation    Since its establishment over six years ago, Economic and Monetary Union has helped to provide a stable macroeconomic environment', 'Over the past few years, the annual inflation rate in the euro area has remained slightly higher than our own definition of price stability, that is a rise in prices of less than 2 % and close to 2%', 'Yet this situation is more a reflection of temporary shocks linked in particular to the trend in the price of crude oil, than to any underlying inflationary trend, which remains generally moderate today', 'Inflation expectations have remained anchored at under 2%, in line with our definition of price stability', 'The fact that the run of oil price hikes has not jeopardised the stability of inflation expectations is no mere coincidence', 'It is a mark of success, showing the high credibility level of the young European Central Bank, which has proven capable of convincingly providing businessmen in an economic area with a population of some 306 million, with a stable anchorage point for their price expectations', 'Thus, as long as inflation and inflation expectations remain solidly anchored to levels compatible with price stability, monetary policy will make a crucial contribution to economic growth by fostering an exceptionally low interest level on the short, medium and long-term markets, and by creating an economic environment that entails minimal distortion and that helps businessmen to make the best decisions', 'In the medium term, the euro area’s prospects rest on crucial factors that should not be overlooked', 'Allow me to briefly run through them', 'On the external level, worldwide activity is fated to remain healthy and it is expected to help sustain European exports', 'On the internal level, investment should continue to benefit from financial conditions that are, historically speaking, exceptionally favourable in the euro area', 'It should benefit also from an improvement in businesses’ results and their increased productivity due to past restructuring', 'Moreover, private consumption is likely to grow in keeping with the growth in real income that is expected to continue', 'Yet in the shorter term, since the second half of 2004, growth in the euro area has been modest, below the area’s potential growth rate', 'It is still positive, of course, but modest', 'There can be no doubt that the increasing cost of raw materials (with crude oil heading the list) has led to increasing uncertainty over economic prospects and that it continues to loom as a risk of far from secondary importance, as indeed do imbalances at the global level', 'Furthermore, consumers are taking their time to rediscover the path of confidence, doubtless on account of a still difficult situation in the labour market, of difficulties and delays in the implementation of basic reforms, and of a feeling of insecurity due to insufficient budget consolidation', 'Sure enough, a good monetary strategy guaranteeing the solid anchoring of price stability is a necessary precondition for economic growth', 'It is not a condition that is sufficient in itself, however', 'A budget strategy guaranteeing healthy public finances and structural reforms making it possible to raise the level of potential economic growth are also crucial', 'An examination of the trend in labour productivity in Europe and in the United States is particularly enlightening in this connection', 'Over the past few years, despite tangible progress in terms of overall employment growth and activity rates, a slowdown in the rise in hourly productivity in the euro area has been the main cause of the gap in economic growth between the euro area and the other major economy in the industrially advanced world, namely the United States', 'This, especially because over the same period of time the United States has enjoyed a strong boost to its hourly productivity, thanks in particular to its efficient use of new information and communication technology', 'Thus while growth in hourly productivity in the 1980s stood at 2', '4% on average in the euro area and at 1', '3% in the United States, that trend inverted between 1996 and 2004, with an annual average in the euro area and in the United States of 1', '3% and of 2', '5% respectively', 'The lack of sufficient structural reform in Europe is, in my view, the main cause of the gap in economic growth between Europe and the United States that we have seen over the past few years', 'If we are to impart a fresh thrust to Europe’s growth potential and to help boost consumer and business confidence, we need to work on the European economy’s most crucial underlying weaknesses and to implement basic reforms', 'Allowing the labour market to work better with a view to boosting growth in employment and productivity, completing the establishment of a large single market, and promoting investment and innovation will be the best way of allowing the European economy to adapt to international competition, to foster the development of businesses, and to accelerate economic growth and the creation of lasting employment', 'Structural reforms    I must say that – although uneven across European countries – significant progress in the implementation of structural reforms has been made, and such an effort should be recognised', 'However, there is still a long way to go', 'In Lisbon in 2000, Heads of State and governments have committed to make the European Union “the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion”', 'The decision on the specific structural reform measures, their design and actual implementation should be left to the Member States', 'While getting closer to one another, EU countries still differ in many respects: in their structure, economic development and institutional setting', 'Leaving it up to the national actors to decide on their reforms is just the natural consequence of such differences', 'However, these reforms should take the EU consensus on policy priorities and objectives as a clear and common reference point', 'Again, let me stress that implementing structural reforms is not an easy task; it needs a lot of courage and determination on the part of governments, parliaments and social partners', 'However, these reforms are most definitely needed, along with stability-oriented monetary and fiscal policy, as an essential ingredient to ensure higher prosperity and job creation in Europe', 'Let me now focus on two areas where I think further progress is most urgently needed: labour and product markets', 'In product markets, there are still considerable productivity gains to be reaped in Europe by removing the remaining barriers to competition that still remain at national and EU level', 'The creation of a common market based on the free movement of goods, services, people and capital is a cornerstone of the European Union since the Treaty of Rome', 'The completion of the single market, in particular in the sector of financial services, is of the essence', 'An essential factor of technological progress and diffusion is human capital', 'Indeed, thanks to technological advancements, economic activity becomes increasingly knowledge-based and jobs shift from low to high-skilled workers', 'However, investment in human capital development in Europe remains insufficient, and a strong focus should be put on improving education and training systems', 'Europe also suffers from insufficient quantitative and qualitative efforts as regards investment in research and development (R&D)', 'As an example at present only two EU countries exceed the target for R&D spending of 3% of GDP', 'All the other EU countries lag behind', 'More efforts in this field are clearly needed', 'Further reforms in labour markets are also crucial in order to improve the flexibility of the labour market', 'It is essential to provide incentives for more people to enter the labour market', 'Increasing labour participation and utilisation is a core challenge for policy, particularly for females, the young and older workers', 'Some countries have started to implement reforms in order to reduce the disincentives to work', 'Unemployment insurance schemes have been amended and early retirement incentives have been reduced', 'Take for instance Denmark and Sweden, where various reforms to improve work incentives and avoid labour supply constraints have been implemented', 'In Denmark, measures aimed at reducing taxes on labour income', 'In Sweden, reforms mainly targeted older workers, immigrants and younger workers', 'Well, both Denmark and Sweden have already exceeded all the EU employment targets, including those for women and for older workers', 'These are two examples where the reform progress in this area has produced clear benefits', 'However, although unemployment insurance systems have been streamlined, in a number of cases, together with high marginal tax rates and social security contributions, they continue to provide a disincentive to take up work', 'EU enlargement    Meeting these challenges has become even more important with the historic enlargement of the European Union in May last year from 15 to 25 Member States', 'Let me first stress that I am convinced that the enlargement entails opportunities and benefits for the EU', 'The economic benefits of enlargement are sometimes neglected in discussions, often overshadowed by fears, such as the risk of mass migration after opening up borders with the new Member States, involving increased pressure on labour markets and welfare systems of the other Member States', 'I do believe that the EU enlargement will contribute positively to economic growth and welfare in the EU as a whole', 'It will provide new opportunities to trade and investment flows', 'The enlargement of the Internal Market will strengthen the degree of competition as the accession of the new Member States has increased the number of suppliers within the Internal Market', 'In addition, enlargement has enhanced the scope for economies of scale, as the extension of the Internal Market increased the size of the market available to suppliers', 'This should translate in lower prices and increased productivity, thereby contributing to a higher potential growth', 'However, these benefits will not be realised automatically', 'Again, in this respect too, there are substantial benefits associated with the implementation of structural reforms', 'In particular, a forceful and prompt completion of the enlarged Internal Market in both the old and the new Member States is essential to fully exploit the benefits of the present enlargement', 'Let me say a few words on the ERM II membership which has already been decided for six currencies out of the ten currencies of the new Member States', 'Having proceeded with the necessary structural adjustments, participation in ERM II can be an important means of anchoring exchange rate and inflation expectations, and of promoting discipline', 'It can help orient macroeconomic policies to stability, while at the same time allowing for a degree of flexibility, if needed, through the wide standard fluctuation band and the possibility of adjusting the central parity', 'In any case, there is not a uniform path to the adoption of the euro and each country will be judged on its own merits before adopting the euro', 'And, as required by the Treaty, the sustainable convergence of the economies concerned will be carefully checked both in the interest of the country concerned and in the interest of the euro area as a whole', 'Fiscal discipline    Finally, I would like to discuss another major challenge that Europe is going to have to face over the next 50 years: an ageing population', 'A few figures may help to illustrate the magnitude of this challenge: According to the forecasts of Eurostat, the European statistics institute, the population of working age (people aged between 15 and 64) is going to drop from 67', '2% of the overall population in 2004 to 56', '7% in 2050', 'At the same time, the proportion of retired people (in other words, people aged 65 or over) is going to rise from 16', '4% of the overall population in 2004 to 29', '9% in 2050', 'These figures are self-explanatory', 'We are on the eve of an unprecedented demographic upheaval which is going to put a major strain on public finances', 'Ageing is going to translate into significant additional budget costs, generally estimated for the next few decades (and only for pensions) at between 3 and 5% of GDP in the majority of European countries', 'These forecasts show quite clearly that demographic change without appropriate reform is likely to weigh down very heavily on public finance', 'I would like to draw your attention to the most important effects of these developments on the sustainability of public finance and growth', 'The pressure that an ageing population will have on public spending could threaten the sustainability of public finance', 'Without a change in policy, public spending due to ageing will lead to a growth in deficits and to an inevitable increase in the public debt', \"These developments will also reflect on businessmen's forecasts\", 'A drop in confidence in Government signatures due to forecasts of an increased risk of default on the public debt could multiply “risk premia” and foster a financial environment less conducive to investment and growth', 'With an ageing population, spending on share-out pension systems is going to increase at the same time as the social security contribution base decreases', 'In the light of such a situation, adjustments in the parameters of these systems, such as for instance a rise in the real retirement age, seem to be essential', 'And more fundamental changes to the structure of pension funding seem to be essential too', 'Growing pressure on the funding of public health systems also calls for courageous reforms', 'Reform of social safety nets is one of the crucial factors, among many others, that will allow us to control the public debt, to guarantee the sustainability of public finance, and to boost growth potential', 'The immediate adoption of a strategy of ambitious reforms along with a firm and credible budget consolidation policy would help to boost Europe’s growth potential without delay', 'In the case of the euro area economies, boosting businessmen’s confidence in budget sustainability and in long-term economic stability as well as in the maintenance of a suitable welfare policy and of reasonable compulsory contribution rates would more than make up for the negative effects that the reforms and budget consolidation might have on demand in the short term', 'The larger the imbalances forecast, the more these “Ricardian”, non “Keynesian”, effects are likely to be seen', 'And an ageing population means major budgetary imbalances in Europe’s future, naturally if the countries concerned fail to take appropriate action', 'In the face of a challenge of this nature, it is crucial to implement the new version of the Pact for Stability and Growth in a stringent manner', 'The Pact is essential from the standpoint of the Economic and Monetary Union’s cohesion, and in that connection it is one of the keystones of confidence in Europe’s economic stability, thus one of the keystones of investment and growth', 'So it is necessary to work with determination on budget consolidation and on bringing down the public debt in order to take on the challenge of an ageing population and to safeguard the credibility of the European budgetary framework', 'Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Europe is facing today five major challenges', 'Three of them are major challenges that equally apply to all the long industrialised countries', 'The last two others are specific to Europe and do not exist anywhere else in the world', 'The diagnosis is now clear as regards the first three challenges – the challenge of new technologies, the challenge of globalisation, the challenge of population ageing – which does not mean either that they are easy to solve… For the first challenge, facilitate the deepening and broadening in the whole economy of science and technology, in particular - but not only - of information technologies', 'For the second, organise the new economic framework stemming from the generalisation of the market economy and the very fast economic development of Asian emerging countries', 'For the third, draw the consequences of population ageing in order to ensure the sustainability of public finances', 'The US, Canada and other industrialised countries must tackle the same issues', 'But in addition – and this is a unique situation in the world, a privilege and at the same time a great historic responsibility – Europe must face two other challenges', 'On one hand, Europe has engaged into a long-term process aimed at ensuring its unity on the basis of a voluntary Union between States', 'These States share in common some elements of their sovereignty and have already decided to create a single market with a single currency', 'This is a very ambitious historic transformation', 'On the other hand, Europe must a the same time meet the challenge of a rapid geographic expansion of an immense historical magnitude', 'We were still 12 countries when the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated', 'We are now 25, and virtually already 27', 'In Europe, are therefore intertwined a unique “vertical” economic and political transformation and a geographic “horizontal” expansion of an immense significance', 'Five major challenges to face, two more that the other industrialised countries', 'All these challenges are exciting, all stem from important successes – scientific progress, the economic take-off of big developing countries, progress in medicine, the deepening of the pacific unity of Europe, the fall of the iron curtain – but these challenges are also demanding and difficult', 'After the French referendum and before the Dutch referendum, we are facing today a difficult moment for Europe and for our 458 million European fellow citizens', 'It is not the first time, and probably not the last time', 'In his Memoirs Jean MONNET, whose ideas and action are at the roots of the European endeavour writes: “Those who do not want to start an endeavour because they are not fully sure that things will go as they have planned in advance, are condemning themselves to be immobile', '” I am sure that Europeans will together find the way allowing them to overcome present difficulties as they did it in the past', 'The European Central Bank has a clear mandate given by the Maastricht Treaty', 'It preserves today and will preserve tomorrow, as it did in the past, price stability and confidence in the currency, which are necessary conditions to sustainable growth and job creations', 'Confidence is a key word in present circumstances', 'Europeans can rely on the ECB and on the Eurosystem as a whole to preserve and consolidate this confidence', 'I thank you for your attention'])]\n",

players in the financial markets and to discuss with them the changing financial market environment after nearly three years of the single currency', 'Overall globalisation and European integration have proceeded very much as parallel phenomena', \"Technological innovation and development, deregulation and the liberalisation of markets for goods and services, as well as the liberalisation of capital movements and financial markets, have linked not only the European economies, but – indeed – all of the world's economies more closely together\", 'Consequent efficiency gains and increased price transparency at all levels have led to an intensification of competition, enhancing the allocation of resources and, to some extent, reducing inflationary pressures', 'It is interesting to note that competition has not stiffened merely among corporations, but also among governments', 'One of the most important elements in European integration is the widening and deepening of the euro area financial markets', 'Corporations, financial market players and the European Central Bank (ECB) have a common interest here, even if the motives and expected benefits differ', 'For the corporate sector, financial market integration means improving financing conditions with a new variety of options', 'For the banking system, it means possibilities for each member of the industry to operate on the same terms throughout the euro area, using all instruments without barriers', 'For the ECB, financial market integration is important as it enhances the efficient implementation of monetary policy and the effective and consistent transmission of its impulses throughout the euro area', 'The strategic goal of the European Union, decided by the EU Council in Lisbon last year and reaffirmed in Stockholm this year, was \"to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion\"', 'This is an ambitious goal that cannot be achieved unless the European Union in general, and the euro area in particular, develops financial markets that are able to channel efficiently the funds required to finance research and development, innovation, and generally to support an entrepreneurial environment', 'In short, we need to aim at reaping the full benefits of the single currency', 'Where are we now, then, as regards the integration phase of the euro area financial markets', 'I must confess that, in the first 18 months since the introduction of the euro, it was very easy to talk about this subject', 'It was easy to present all the areas in which progress had been made', 'We were in fact positively surprised by the rapid integration', 'Perhaps we became too optimistic about the future, but today it is more difficult to find new developments to draw attention as most of the progress was made during the first year of the euro', 'Compared with the extremely rapid developments we witnessed in 1999, the process towards integration seems to have slowed down considerably', 'In the foreign exchange market, integration was of course achieved immediately as the national euro area currencies instantly became one currency', 'This is reflected in the Triennial Central Bank Survey conducted by 48 central banks and monetary authorities in April 2001 and co-ordinated by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)', 'It was the first comprehensive assessment of activity on the foreign exchange and derivatives markets since the introduction of the euro in 1999', 'The preliminary data, which were published by the BIS on 9 October, confirmed that the euro was the second most widely traded currency in April 2001, behind the US dollar and ahead of the Japanese yen, entering on one side of somewhat less than 40% of \"net-net\" foreign exchange transactions, i', 'e', 'transactions adjusted for both local and cross-border double-counting', 'This represents a decrease of 15 percentage points compared with the aggregate share of its legacy currencies in April 1998, which stood above 50%', 'This decrease is mainly attributable to the elimination of intra-euro area foreign exchange trading; in 1998, intra-euro area transactions accounted for approximately 10% of net global foreign exchange market turnover', 'This elimination of the intra-euro area transactions was also one of the important factors behind the sizeable decline in global foreign exchange activity', 'Average daily turnover in traditional foreign exchange markets was estimated to have fallen by nearly 20% from some USD 1,500 billion in April 1998 to approximately USD 1,200 billion in April 2001', 'The growing use of electronic brokering and the consolidation of the banking industry were additional factors contributing to the significant decrease', 'Despite the overall decline in turnover, several dealers indicated that bid-offer spreads and liquidity remained similar to the levels recorded at the time of the previous study', 'In line with traditional foreign exchange market activity, over-the-counter (OTC) foreign exchange derivatives activity declined by more than 30%', 'However, overall OTC derivatives turnover, which includes foreign exchange contracts, such as currency swaps and options, and interest rate instruments, increased significantly in 2001 compared with 1998', 'The sum of the average daily turnover of euro-related OTC foreign exchange derivatives and OTC interest rate derivatives amounted to USD 260 billion, which is a little less than 50% of total reported OTC derivatives turnover', \"Interest rate derivatives accounted for the lion's share and the volume of these has now strongly increased compared with previous surveys\", 'This leads me to the developments in the money market', 'The considerable growth of interest rate instruments resulted from a strong increase in swaps and forward rate agreements (FRAs)', 'Transactions in euro have been fostered by the creation of a large, liquid and integrated money market in the euro area', 'For example, swap and FRA transactions increased by 104% and 85%, respectively, between April 1998 and April 2001', 'The unsecured and swap segments have for some time now been showing a high degree of integration and the BIS survey confirms that the growth in the swap market has been particularly significant', 'The EONIA reference interest rate has established itself as one of the most important, or even the most important, reference rate', 'The EONIA swap market is now considered the largest overnight swap market in the world', 'The market for short-term securities and the repo market, by contrast, still remain poorly integrated: even if both markets have taken some steps towards integration, clear fragmentation among the euro area countries remains', 'The question is whether the lack of full integration in these two segments emanates exclusively from regulatory difficulties or if there is also a lack of co-ordination on the part of the private sector', 'From our regular contacts with market participants, from the surveys that take place in the context of our money market reports and from our meetings with financial market associations, such as the ACI, we understand that the most serious obstacle to integration is the fragmentation in the infrastructure', 'In addition to the lack of harmonisation in the trading environment and settlement systems, the differences in the legal systems are explicitly mentioned by market participants', 'In the legal field, bankruptcy legislation as well as laws concerning guarantees, collateral and the transfer of collateral are the main impediments to successful integration', 'In the bond market, in the same way as in the money market, the euro played a crucial role in fostering the deeper and more liquid euro area bond market that we see today', 'We have already seen that international investors have taken advantage of this development in their search for investment opportunities and we have also seen significant issuance activity in the euro area bond market', 'Still, the integration of the bond market, too, has slowed down and is far from complete', 'We still have a clear national segmentation with liquidity differences', 'The impediments here are exactly the same as in the money market: the regulatory and legal framework, infrastructure differences and different market practices', 'Further integration of the euro area financial markets is needed     It is clear that we need, in particular, to intensify our efforts to support internal financial market integration in the euro area', 'Very many initiatives and activities are involved in the process, but this process seems to be taking too long', 'We should clearly be able to speed it up', 'Resolving the legislative issues, the statutory regulation problems, which are the responsibility of governments and parliaments, is of course much more difficult at a European level, with many national interests, than at the national level', 'The governments of the EU Member States should, however, see the urgency of the harmonisation and the benefits for growth and well-being which can be achieved by the integration', 'The ECB, as a market participant itself, shares the concern of the market in this area', 'As an institution with a euro-wide perspective, we are willing to support the efforts to move obstacles in this field, even if they are areas where we have no direct responsibility', 'Not only the legislative efforts are important and urgent; the same holds true of the efforts in the \"self-regulatory\" area and in the co-ordination of market participants themselves', 'For example, securities settlement systems are in many cases run and used by private entities, the same as those that participate in the market', 'A solution in this area has to be found through a better co-ordination of market participants themselves', 'An interesting example of co-operation between the ECB and market participants is the calculation of the EONIA reference rate, where market participants deemed it necessary for the calculation to be made by a third party who could receive the data on a confidential basis', 'A further example is the consolidation in central counterparty clearing, where economies of scale and network externalities seem to favour a high degree of concentration', 'A group of major global investment banks has therefore expressed support for the idea that Europe should have only one central counterparty clearing house, which would provide a multi-currency and multi-product service', 'However, there is no single view, particularly within the euro area, about the infrastructure that should prevail', 'The Eurosystem is carefully monitoring and analysing developments in this field', 'Indeed, central counterparty clearing could have implications for the smooth execution of monetary policy operations, the smooth operation of payment and settlement systems and the stability of the financial markets in general', \"The consolidation process adds to the complexity of the issue: on the one hand, consolidation in central counterparty clearing could help to increase efficiency in the clearing and settlement of securities; on the other hand, the potential systemic consequences of a central counterparty's failure increase with its size\", 'In this regard, the ECB has concluded that, owing to the potential systemic importance of securities clearing and settlement systems, the Eurosystem has an interest in central counterparty clearing and considers it essential to establish, in co-operation with the other relevant authorities, effective risk management standards', 'The natural geographical scope for any \"domestic\" market infrastructure (including central counterparty clearing) for securities and derivatives denominated in euro is the euro area', 'Given the potential systemic importance of securities clearing and settlement systems, this infrastructure should be located within the euro area', 'Whatever the final architecture, it is essential that access to facilities for trading, clearing and settlement should not be unfairly impeded', 'This policy of open and fair access should ensure the safety, legal soundness and efficiency of securities clearing and settlement systems, guarantee a level playing field, and avoid an excessive fragmentation of market liquidity', 'The field of central counterparty clearing is just one case in point where we, the ECB and the national central banks, are willing to do everything in our power to support the integration process', 'We need a euro area financial system that offers opportunities for all participants to have access to capital on terms that will lead to the most efficient allocation of resources, hence potentially to higher sustainable growth rates', 'We need to see that there is an ability among market participants to co-ordinate themselves and work together in order to promote this process further', 'Indeed, this integration cannot be the responsibility of the public authorities alone', 'Our role in the Eurosystem is to create an environment that is favourable for investment and economic activity', 'Mainly, we contribute to this environment by maintaining price stability over the medium term', 'You as market participants can achieve the necessary integration by taking advantage of the opportunities that the large financial market place of the euro area provides'])\n",
      " list(['Introduction Thank you for your invitation to speak here today', 'In my short intervention, I will focus on the question how post-crisis monetary, fiscal and macroprudential policies in Europe should look like', 'Rapid and determined policy action have avoided that things turned worse at the peak of the crisis, but now that the worst seems to be behind us, it is time to look further ahead', 'Notably, we need to reverse what should only be temporary, and implement what needs to be changed structurally, so as to reduce chances of such a crisis from occuring again', 'Monetary policy Let me start with monetary policy', 'After the crisis had intensified significantly, a bit more than one year ago, the ECB responded swiftly and vigorously', 'In particular, it lowered its main interest rates substantially by 325 basis points between October 2008 and May 2009', 'The current rate of 1% is the lowest since monetary union started in 1999', 'In addition, we have taken a number of non-standard liquidity and credit support measures to mitigate the adverse impact of dysfunctional money markets on the liquidity situation of solvent banks in the euro area and thereby avoid the emergence of a systemic liquidity crisis', 'To this end, for instance, we provided banks with unlimited liquidity against an expanded list of collateral, while prolonging the maturity of our refinancing operations up to 1 year', 'From the very beginning, we have made clear that our enhanced credit support measures would be temporary in nature and remain in place only as long as needed', 'Now, taking into account the ongoing improvements in financial market conditions, we arrived at a situation where in fact not all our liquidity measures are needed to the same extent as in the past', 'Therefore, we announced last week some initial steps to gradually phasing out some of these measures', 'At the same time, we continue to provide liquidity support to the euro area banks for an extended period of time at favourable conditions, as – despite the start of the phasing out – the impact of previously taken measures reach well into the next year', 'While we are still in a period of high uncertainty, and we should not exclude setbacks on the road back to sustainable growth rates and stable financial market conditions, we also need to prepare ourselves for ‘normal’ times', 'In this respect, in particular with a view to the recent experience, we need to ask ourselves whether the way monetary policy is conducted needs to be changed', 'On that, let me first say that the primary objective of the ECB is and remains to maintain price stability over the medium term, and we have continued succeeding in that when looking at measures of inflation expectations which are well anchored in line with price stability', 'Secondly, in our comprehensive assessment of economic and monetary developments we already take into account a wide set of indicators, including for example also asset prices and credit developments', 'Thus, there is no need for changing our monetary policy framework in a fundamental way', 'Nonetheless, the crisis has shown that a more detailed and refined analysis of financial market indicators is important for both, financial stability and monetary policy objectives', 'Here we need to further invest and become more wary of how financial market risks can effect the macroeconomic environment', 'Fiscal policies As regards fiscal policies, I am concerned about the projected strong increase of government deficit and debt levels in euro area countries', 'According to the European Commission, the deficit ratio in the euro area would reach around 7% of GDP in 2010 compared to 2% in 2008; government debt as a ratio to GDP is expected to increase to 84% compared to 69% in 2008', '13 out of 16 euro area Member states are now facing an excessive deficit procedure due to budget deficits above the 3% of GDP deficit criterion of the Maastricht Treaty', 'Certainly, the fiscal measures to stabilise the financial sector and the wider economy have helped to limit the adverse effects of the economic and financial crisis', 'However, it is now time to prepare ambitious and well-defined fiscal exit strategies', 'Otherwise, government debt in the euro area is set to quickly rise to levels above 100% of GDP, which might severely undermine the public’s trust in the sustainability of public finances', 'Moreover, unsustainable debt developments would, in the medium to long-term, put upward pressure on interest rates', 'At the European level, the fiscal consolidation process should be guided by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact', 'First, this implies to set realistic but also sufficiently ambitious deadlines to correct excessive deficits in euro area countries', 'The ECOFIN Council has adopted recommendations for country-specific deadlines and fiscal adjustment requirements this month', 'Second, national governments need to specify their fiscal consolidation strategy and underpin it by well-specified measures', 'Given the projected strong increase in public spending ratios in euro area countries, governments should focus on expenditure-based fiscal consolidation', 'In the past, this has also proven to me more effective than tax increases to achieve successful fiscal consolidation', 'Macroprudential policies A formidable challenge for the central banking community in the period ahead is to respond in the best possible way to calls to enhance macro-prudential oversight', 'In the EU, a decision has been taken to establish a European Systemic Risk Board', 'This body will be responsible for carrying systemic risk surveillance and assessment at an EU-wide level and, where considered necessary, to translate these assessments into risk warnings and possibly policy recommendations', 'The financial crisis has illustrated that a very large gap exists between, on the one hand, the risk surveillance and assessment tasks and, on the other, the advice on risk mitigation and possible policy follow-ups', 'The establishment of the ESRB along with its sister body, the European System of Financial Supervision, which will work in close co-operation, should represent a significant step in this direction', 'In the new setting, macro-prudential policy instruments should aim at influencing variables such as maturity mismatches, excessive credit growth, leverage, or the risk appetite of market participants', 'The types of policy tools that might be activated to address systemic risks may include counter cyclical capital buffers, enhanced liquidity requirements, forward-looking loan-loss provisioning, leverage ratios, haircut and collateral requirements in secured lending, or setting maximum loan-to-value ratios on mortgages', 'In this sense, the use of these policy tools should take account of both macro-financial and contagion aspects, and most likely will require a continuous interaction between the ESRB and the relevant supervisory and regulatory authorities', 'Progress has been made in laying out a framework for systemic risk surveillance and assessment', 'The ESRB – or, for that matter, any other body responsible macro-prudential oversight – will aim at reducing systemic risk', 'The establishment of the ESRB but also the new EU supervisory architecture mean that vulnerabilities and potential sources of risk for the financial system will be detected in a timelier manner', 'This will foster better awareness of these risks and their potential implications', 'Regulation will make the system more resilient', 'In fact, to the extent that we can narrow the policy gap between systemic risk assessments and their translation into risk mitigating policy actions, this will ultimately enhance the financial system’s resilience to adverse disturbances', 'In this sense the political support for these reforms is absolutely essential', 'Conclusion  Let me conclude', 'Monetary and fiscal policies, through vigorous and swift action at the peak of the financial crisis, have avoided a free fall in economic activity and a further drying up of financial markets', 'As we gradually seem to be leaving the extraordinary circumstances behind us, monetary and fiscal policies must return to their normal mode of operation', 'Will that normal mode look different from the one before the crisis', 'As for monetary policy, you can be assured that the ECB will monitor all developments carefully and continue to gradually phase-out at the appropriate time its enhanced credit support measures, without hampering the functioning of financial markets', 'Let me also assure you that maintaining price stability remains our primary objective', 'At the same time, let me also emphasize that central banks must become more wary of financial market risks and their macroeconomic implications to the overall benefit of achieving the monetary policy objective', 'As regards fiscal policies, consolidation efforts need to be implemented timely and credibly, and as in the past with a particular focus on the expenditure side', 'As to macroprudential policies, the recent crisis has strikingly illustrated the interconnectedness that characterizes the financial system', 'This has reaffirmed the need to strengthen macroprudential policies, i', 'e', 'the focus on the systemic nature of risks and their mitigation to reduce the chances on such a crisis from happening again need', 'Finally, let us not forget the importance of self set standards and rules by the financial markets themselves', 'Importantly, the financial industry must be aware of their own responsibility and need to draw the right lessons from the crisis for future practises', 'Thank you for your attention', 'back to top                    SEE ALSO  Find out more about related content   Annex'])\n",
      " list(['Ladies and Gentlemen,  Introduction It is a great pleasure to speak to you at this year’s International Monetary Conference', 'Let me start by congratulating the organisers for devising a programme that precisely pinpoints the key challenges that policy-makers must address on the path towards a more resilient financial sector', 'The financial sector constitutes the main link between monetary policy and the real economy', 'So the challenges associated with financial stress and the prospects for financial reform are close to the heart of every central banker', 'The economic situation in the euro area remains challenging but there are a few signs of a possible stabilisation, and our baseline scenario continues to be one of a very gradual recovery starting in the latter part of this year', 'The drivers of such a gradual recovery are the highly accommodative monetary policy and export growth, caused by growing foreign demand', 'There is an adjustment happening across the board, with fiscal deficits and external deficits declining', 'The price of energy is declining as well and finally there are a number of important wealth effects that can support consumption and investment', 'These effects come from the rebound of financial markets that is benefitting virtually all economic agents, including corporations, banks and households', 'Nevertheless, vulnerabilities remain, and I would like to take this opportunity to share my thoughts on the appropriate policy response to remaining financial and economic vulnerabilities from a euro area perspective', 'In doing so, I will focus on the banking system, which accounts for around two thirds of financial intermediation in the euro area', 'When analysing the capacity and willingness of euro area banks to lend, it is useful to distinguish three factors: their funding situation; their capital position; and their attitude towards risk', 'Each of these factors may, at times, require targeted policy intervention to overcome obstacles to bank lending', 'But the types of policy intervention and the domains of policy responsibility fundamentally differ across these three factors', 'In this context, let me outline what I believe are the three major lessons of the crisis', 'First, the crisis has reconfirmed both the scope and the limits of what central banks can do to support the economy', 'Central banks play a pivotal role in stabilising funding conditions at times of acute market turmoil', 'But they cannot compensate for weaknesses in banks’ capital positions', 'And they cannot substitute for reforms to boost the growth potential of economies', 'Second, in the euro area, the crisis has demonstrated the capacity and unwavering commitment of the European Central Bank (ECB) to support the economy in its pursuit of price stability', 'We have adopted monetary policy measures that are unprecedented in scale and scope', 'In doing so, we have benefitted from the array of different perspectives on the Governing Council', 'These different perspectives collectively shape the single monetary policy for all euro area countries and form a durable basis for our united institutional decisions', 'Third, the crisis has shown the need to adjust our monetary policy toolkit to a new reality', 'A very important new tool have been the two 3-year LTROs (long-term refinancing operations) that helped avoid a massive euro area wide credit crunch in early 2012', 'But the most salient feature of this new reality is financial fragmentation across euro area countries', 'In response, the ECB has adopted Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs)', 'This policy initiative was necessary to counteract the threats to price stability; it has been effective in mitigating fragmentation and especially in fulfilling our mandate of maintaining price stability', 'Let me explain in a little more detail', 'Improving banks’ funding situation As the crisis has demonstrated forcefully, a sudden retreat of market liquidity can severely rattle financial markets', 'Unable to refinance their illiquid assets, banks are forced either to explore alternative sources of funding or to engage in large-scale fire sales to shrink that part of their assets that remains tradable, although at falling prices', 'To avoid socially costly fire sales and in common with most other central banks, the ECB compensated for the shortfall in private finance by providing solvent banks with additional central bank liquidity against adequate collateral', 'In doing so, the Governing Council followed three avenues', 'First, we provided these banks with ample access to central bank liquidity – both by reducing our main policy rate and by expanding the collateral pool against which we would lend to euro area banks', 'Second, we provided reassurance to market participants that ample access to central bank liquidity would persist over the relevant planning horizon', 'Most notably, our two three-year long-term refinancing operations (LTROs) assured banks that their liquidity needs would be met over horizons that stretch beyond the usual maturity of central bank credit', 'In fact, the LTROs come closer to matching the average maturity of their loan books', 'Third, we forcefully confronted financial fragmentation which has weakened the impact of monetary policy in the very parts of the euro area where it is most needed', 'Fragmentation has created divergent borrowing conditions for firms and households with equal creditworthiness but different country codes', 'As our main tool to combat fragmentation, we adopted Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs)', 'OMTs allow for targeted intervention in euro area sovereign debt markets – provided the country concerned commits itself to strict and effective conditionality under an EU/IMF economic adjustment programme', 'A closer look at OMTs At almost one year from its announcement, the benefits of OMT are visible to everybody:  Spreads in sovereign debt markets have fallen substantially', 'Since the OMT announcement, spreads on long-term bonds for Spain, Italy and Ireland have fallen by around 250 to 300 basis points and for Portugal by almost 600 basis points', 'Spreads in corporate debt markets have fallen by about 150 to 200 basis points for important market segments, and made it easier for firms to raise funds in the market', 'This has been the case for highly rated large corporations as well as for other corporations', 'Banks have been able to re-access the market, for both funding and for raising capital, and the strong divergence in funding costs across constituencies has receded somewhat', 'Deposits have flown back: banks in stressed countries have seen the deposits by the euro area money-holding sector increasing by about 200 billion euros since August 2012', 'Another sign of normalisation, and a very important one for German savers, pension funds and insurance companies, has been the increase in German government bond yields, previously suppressed by panic-driven safe-haven flows, which have edged up by around 25 basis points', 'And the best summary indicator for fragmentation and related payment flows in the euro area, the level of Target balances, has shown a decline by 285 billion euros, or 25%, since the peak last year', 'Target balances now roughly stand at levels prevailing before the launch of the two 3-year LTROs in late-2011', 'The establishment of OMT has therefore been beneficial to everybody: sovereigns, corporations, banks as well as individuals, and it has benefitted both periphery and core countries', 'Therefore, I would like to reflect in more detail on this measure', 'What is its purpose', 'OMTs are aimed at eliminating redenomination risk from the markets – the unwarranted anticipation of euro area breakup', 'Redenomination risk undermined our ability to preserve price stability and contravened the singleness of monetary policy', 'The possibility that financial claims may be redeemed in a different unit of account than the one in which they were denominated at issuance – that is, the euro – was the prime source of panic that fractured transmission of monetary policy a year ago', 'OMTs priced that risk out of market values and act as a deterrent against a resurgence of fundamentally unjustified redenomination fears', 'But their role is cast within a robust framework in which the ECB can fulfil its primary task of ensuring stable prices in steady financial conditions', 'And the fiscal authorities can take care of their solvency conditions and concentrate on structural adjustment', 'One concern that has been raised with regard to OMTs is that they may discourage reform at the national level', 'Quite the opposite is true', 'OMTs can be applied only if governments accept policy conditionality that leads to reforms', 'At the same time, it was the requirement of effective conditionality embedded in OMTs discourages governments and parliaments from requesting a programme unless strictly necessary', 'They can either reform without OMTs and retain economic sovereignty or they can reform with OMTs but give up some of their economic sovereignty', 'Either way, they have to persevere in their reform efforts', 'So it is quite misleading to compare OMTs to historical episodes in which governments relied on central bank support to replace fiscal consolidation', 'Another concern made against OMT was that conditionality weakens the independence of monetary policy', 'The reality is that OMT’s are not tied to political decisions since the Governing Council retains its full discretion, even after a country has engaged in a programme', 'In addition, that same conditionality ensures that the governments remain solvent, which in turn protects the freedom of action of monetary policy', 'A third argument made against OMTs suggests that they would reintroduce excessive compression of euro area bond yield spreads, as observed prior to the crisis', 'This too is inaccurate', 'OMTs are designed to keep government bond yields just below ‘panic’ levels, as previously defined, not to bring them down to levels that would somehow help government solvency', 'As we have seen, the mere existence of OMTs keeps government bond yields from rising excessively: the market expects that if yields rose too much, governments would apply for the programme and ECB purchases would bring yields back down', 'OMTs have therefore had a self-fulfilling downward effect on yields, just as before, in absence of OMT, there was a self-fulfilling upward effect with a potentially catastrophic risk for the euro area', 'But this downward effect does not mean that spreads are forced to converge', 'In fact, ECB intervention under OMTs would not address those parts of sovereign bond yield spreads that are fundamentally justified', 'The implication of a high backstop rate is that governments continue to have the incentives to raise their primary balance towards stabilising levels and to engage in structural reform', 'These are the only two options for them to lower their funding costs well below the backstop level implied by the OMTs', 'For governments and parliaments, the ultimate driver of their actions remains employment', 'It is important to recall that always and especially in the present situation, the need for governments and parliaments to reform does not stem so much from the bond market but from the dramatic conditions in the labour market', 'Unfortunately, millions of unemployed are a much greater driver to reform that the interest rate to be paid on sovereign debt', 'And unfortunately, OMTs have almost no effect on the sources of employment creation', 'Indeed, while OMTs have eliminated one dimension of financial fragmentation (the risk of euro breakup), they only have a muted and indirect effect on the other source of fragmentation – the adverse feedback loop between sovereigns and banks', 'A final criticism of OMTs is portraying them as a means of transferring risks from peripheral to core euro area countries via the ECB balance sheet', 'Quite the opposite has happened: the elimination of catastrophic outcomes strongly benefits core countries', 'To see this, recall that the tail risks that OMTs seek to address distort financial prices and quantities in both the core and the periphery', 'Tail risks generate a glut of liquidity in core banking systems, as monetary assets are relocated by panicking investors from fragile countries to safe-havens', 'With OMTs, pressure to reform remains on peripheral countries, while re-establishing confidence in the euro area reduces the flows of money from the periphery to the core countries like Germany', 'So what do the data say', 'I mentioned already the large decline in overall Target balances, and it is important to add here that this improvement has materialised also for Germany: the Target claim of Germany has fallen from a peak of 760 billion euros in the middle of last year to about 590 billion euros last month', 'This is a decrease of 170 billion euros or 22%', 'This important improvement largely reflects the removal of unwarranted fears of a systemic collapse of monetary union that was previously priced-in by markets', 'Today, the euro area is therefore a more stable and resilient place to invest in than it was a year ago', 'And not a single euro of government bonds has been purchased under the OMT programme', 'Strengthening banks’ risk absorption capacity Banks’ capital position clearly lies outside the remit of central banks', 'In fact, it is – first and foremost – the responsibility of shareholders to ensure that their bank is solvent and able to sustain its core business', 'And if the private sector is unable or unwilling to provide the capital necessary to achieve solvency, it is for the fiscal and regulatory authorities to decide whether and how to act', 'Monetary policy cannot substitute for or subsidise either of these policy domains', 'But the euro area has achieved significant progress in terms of solvency', 'Banks have received fresh capital', 'Problematic legacy assets have been removed from banks’ balance sheets, notably in countries under financial assistance programmes More remains to be done', 'In particular, two policy initiatives should take precedence', 'First, we need to create full transparency about the risks on banks’ balance sheets', 'Such transparency is a pre-condition for the banking sector to return to lasting health', 'And a healthy banking sector is a pre-condition to revitalising bank lending', 'Second, we must align investors’ incentives with those of society', 'This means that market participants that stand to benefit from the upside of risky activities should also bear commensurate losses on the downside', 'Europe is making some progress in these areas too', 'To strengthen transparency, we are establishing a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), which tasks the ECB with overseeing major parts of the European banking system', 'By placing this responsibility with an independent institution at European level, the Single Supervisory Mechanism will ultimately allow earlier identification of financial risk', 'To strengthen incentives, the institutional architecture is being augmented by rules to facilitate investor participation in dealing with distressed banks', 'In particular, harmonised rules and procedures for bank recovery and resolution are currently being developed at European level', 'To ensure a fully consistent and effective application of these rules, their implementation should be placed within the remit of an independent Single Resolution Mechanism', 'Before the ECB takes over the SSM, it will conduct together with the national supervisory authorities and with an appropriate involvement of private sector companies, a balance sheet review of those banks that it takes into the SSM', 'To this end, the national budgets and where needed, the ESM will have to provide adequate backstop', 'Mitigating macroeconomic risk The final determinant of banks’ capacity and willingness to lend concerns their attitude towards risk', 'Like any central bank, the ECB cannot control microeconomic risk – how banks assess whether a specific potential borrower will fail to repay a loan', 'But the ECB is actively contributing to a reduction in macroeconomic risk: by firmly stabilising inflation expectations, it provides a nominal anchor for the economy as a whole', 'This supports lending and borrowing decisions, and ensures that longer-term investment projects remain profitable', 'But it is the responsibility of national governments to eliminate uncertainty about growth and the sustainability of public finances', 'Without unravelling the progress already achieved, it will be essential to focus consolidation on the fiscal composition of the budget, reducing those expenditures that make the least contribution to growth and reducing the tax burden on economic activity', 'To inspire confidence, policy-makers must follow-through with their fiscal reform agenda', 'In fact, little would be gained from a loosening of fiscal adjustment today if it creates market expectations that additional tightening will become necessary tomorrow', 'In the medium term, we need to ensure that the adjustment is based on increasing the productivity of our economies', 'Only through steadfast pursuit of such structural reforms can the competitiveness of euro area economies in the global marketplace be restored', 'Summary and outlook Let me summarise', 'Strengthening financial resilience requires ambitious policy efforts in various areas', 'Lending to the real economy can only be expected to resume if accommodative monetary policy is accompanied by swift balance sheet repair and determined fiscal and structural reforms', 'Within the euro area, recent progress suggests that decision-makers are ready to tackle the simultaneous tasks of reforming their domestic economies and completing the institutional architecture at the European level', 'The ECB will continue to support macroeconomic performance by ensuring price stability in the euro area', 'In calibrating our policy response to future challenges, the ECB will remain deeply committed to our monetary policy framework', 'That framework is characterised by pursuing unambiguously price stability, firmly preserving our central bank independence and tailoring our policy instruments to the specific challenges at hand, while maintaining fixed our price stability objective', 'As such, our framework is inspired by successful experiences of other central banks which have demonstrated the benefits for monetary policy to rely on a sound institutional anchor, and have earned trust and respect based on their clear commitment to price stability', 'The ECB has the same commitment and has the task to implement its monetary policy not in a single-country but in a multi-country setting', 'This different context and the unprecedented threats to financial stability during the crisis have required new instruments to achieve the same objective of medium-term price stability for the whole of the euro area', 'We have consistently delivered on that commitment ever since the euro was launched', 'Over these last 13 years, inflation expectations have on average been at 1', '9%', 'Thank you for your attention'])\n",
      " list(['On 1 March, the ECB started quantitative tightening (QT) after eight years of balance sheet expansion', '[1] At the peak in 2022, the Eurosystem held monetary policy assets corresponding to around 56% of euro area GDP', 'This was substantial both from a historical perspective and in international comparison (Slide 2, left-hand side)', 'The first wave of balance sheet expansion was a response to the low-inflation environment prevailing in the aftermath of the euro area sovereign debt crisis', 'Between 2014 and 2016 headline inflation ran persistently below our target of 2%, averaging just 0', '3% (Slide 2, right-hand side)', '[2]  As the key policy rate had already been lowered into negative territory in 2014 and was approaching the effective lower bound, the ECB started employing “unconventional” monetary policy tools', 'It offered banks a series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and conducted asset purchases to stimulate economic activity and raise inflation', 'These operations led to a sharp increase in monetary policy assets and, correspondingly, to a rise in central bank liabilities in the form of excess reserves – that is, reserves held by banks beyond minimum requirements (Slide 3)', 'The second wave of balance sheet expansion came with the ECB’s response to the pandemic', 'The launch of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and adjustments to the third series of TLTROs resulted in a further large increase of our monetary policy assets', 'These measures were necessary to protect the euro area economy from falling into a full-blown financial crisis and economic depression', '[3]  Last July, balance sheet growth came to a halt when we ended net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP)', 'Since autumn, the size of the balance sheet has been declining as banks began repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans', 'The balance sheet has declined further since the beginning of March, when we stopped fully reinvesting maturing securities bought under the APP', '[4]  Further TLTRO repayments and a gradual run-down of our monetary policy bond portfolio imply that our balance sheet is expected to decline meaningfully over the coming years, thereby reducing excess liquidity', '[5]  However, the size of our balance sheet will not return to the levels seen before the global financial crisis', 'Over the long run, the ECB’s balance sheet size is driven by growth in reserve requirements and by what are known as autonomous factors, which are beyond the control of the Eurosystem', '[6]  Autonomous factors include official sector deposits and, most importantly, banknotes in circulation, which have shown a strong upward trend since 2007', '[7] If, over the coming years, these autonomous factors were to increase in line with recent historical patterns, we estimate that excess liquidity will be fully absorbed by 2029', '[8]  At that point, the Eurosystem’s balance sheet would still be about three times the size it was in 2007, and it would need to increase again to meet growth in currency demand', 'From a monetary policy perspective, the question is whether the decline in the volume of excess reserves will affect our ability to implement monetary policy', 'In recent years, excess reserves have been instrumental in effectively steering short-term interest rates', 'In my remarks today, I will first explain why the decline in excess reserves matters for the conduct of monetary policy', 'I will also describe why it may be difficult to return to the way we implemented monetary policy before 2008, when excess liquidity was limited', 'I will then illustrate the benefits and costs of alternative operational frameworks that differ in the way they provide reserves to the banking system, and discuss how these may accommodate the characteristics of a heterogeneous currency union like the euro area', 'These remarks reflect my own current thinking on the matter, which may evolve as the Governing Council reviews the Eurosystem’s operational framework – a process we hope to conclude before the end of the year', 'From corridor to floor: the role of excess reserves Before 2008, the ECB, and most other major central banks, implemented monetary policy in a “corridor” system', 'This means we provided just enough central bank reserves to meet banks’ aggregate liquidity needs stemming from net autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements', 'In matching supply and demand in aggregate terms, the ECB steered unsecured overnight rates to the middle of the corridor (Slide 4)', '[9] As a result, excess liquidity was negligible', 'This framework was successful in practice: the ECB was able to closely align overnight rates with the interest rate charged on our weekly main refinancing operations (MRO) (Slide 5)', 'However, after 2008 periods of rising excess liquidity due to monetary policy operations repeatedly pushed unsecured overnight rates towards the deposit facility rate (DFR), which is the floor of the interest rate corridor', 'When we launched the APP in 2015 and excess liquidity started to grow rapidly, we effectively moved from a “corridor” towards a “floor” system', 'Conceptually, the supply curve shifted further and further to the right, now crossing the demand curve at its flat, highly elastic part, where discrete changes in liquidity have very little effect on the level of short-term interest rates (Slide 6)', 'Balance sheet run-down will reverse this shift, progressively moving the supply curve back towards the steep part of the demand curve', 'In the current situation, the large volume of excess reserves means that we should still be at a significant distance from that point', 'Yet, uncertainty about the exact location of the “kink” is very high', 'One reason for this is that years of large excess reserves have blurred our understanding of banks’ underlying demand for liquidity', 'The aggregate level of reserves has been largely determined by the quantity of asset purchases rather than by banks’ liquidity choices', 'Should the demand for reserves have shifted more fundamentally, then upward pressure on interest rates may well start earlier than estimates of the historical relationship between the level of excess reserves and market rates would suggest (Slide 7)', 'This is broadly what happened in the United States in the autumn of 2019, when interest rate volatility spiked unexpectedly although the supply of reserves was still considerably above what banks had indicated in surveys as their lowest comfortable level', '[10]  It is therefore prudent to start reviewing the options available to ensure that  the ECB maintains control over the level of short-term money market rates during the process of balance sheet normalisation', 'Reserve demand has become larger and less predictable The natural starting point for a discussion about the operational framework is to ask what has changed since we last operated in an environment of balanced liquidity conditions', 'The ability to effectively steer overnight rates in the pre-2008 corridor framework relied heavily on two features', 'The first was our ability to accurately predict the reserves needed to steer the operational target towards the middle of the corridor', 'In the steep part of the demand curve, even small changes in the supply of, or demand for, reserves can lead to large swings in interest rates', 'The second feature was a well-functioning interbank market that distributed central bank reserves efficiently across the euro area banking system', 'The standing facilities were not designed to be used on a regular basis but were supposed to accommodate unforeseen liquidity shocks', '[11]  Over the past decade, however, the environment in which central banks operate has changed fundamentally', 'In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, large excess reserves and prevailing fragmentation have considerably reduced the volume of reserves intermediated through the unsecured interbank market (Slide 8)', 'It is not clear whether the interbank market will recover once excess reserves become scarcer', 'A structural decline in banks’ risk tolerance may have permanently reduced the capacity of the euro area interbank market to efficiently distribute reserves across banks all over the euro area', 'And while tighter financial regulation has made our financial system safer and more resilient, it has made interbank lending more costly', '[12]  Banks might also want to hold much higher liquidity buffers than in the past', 'The recent experience of Sveriges Riksbank is a case in point', 'In recent weeks, it regularly issued certificates amounting to the estimated liquidity surplus of the banking system to steer the Swedish Krona short-term rate to the middle of the interest rate corridor', 'However, banks often decided to hold on to about one fifth of excess reserves which they placed in the deposit facility that pays a lower rate of remuneration, so that the short-term rate remained stuck to the floor of the corridor (Slide 9)', 'This points to banks’ strong preference for reserves, which may affect the ability of central banks to effectively steer short-term rates in a large corridor system, such as the one we had before 2008', '[13]  There are two main reasons as to why banks may today wish to hold a higher level of excess reserves', 'One relates to regulatory changes', 'The introduction of Basel III has resulted in a measurable increase in the demand for high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that banks need to hold to comply with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)', '[14]  Many euro area banks currently use excess reserves to meet regulatory requirements, especially in those countries with high excess liquidity', 'For the euro area as a whole, excess reserves currently account for 60% of HQLA holdings (Slide 10)', 'The second factor relates to banks’ precautionary behaviour in guarding against liquidity risks, as the turbulent events in the past few weeks forcefully underline', 'Overnight deposits at euro area banks have shown an upward trend in relation to banks’ total deposits until about mid-2022 (Slide 11, left-hand side)', '[15] As a result, the risk of withdrawals or portfolio rebalancing has increased', 'The rise in overnight deposits is in part a mechanical effect of asset purchases, which increase deposit holdings of those selling bonds to the Eurosystem', 'It also reflects the long period of very low interest rates that sharply reduced the opportunity costs of holding “money-like” claims', 'Both of these effects can be expected to reverse as we remove monetary policy accommodation', 'When we last increased interest rates, from 2005 until mid-2008, overnight deposits as a share of total deposits fell by about seven percentage points as firms and households shifted savings into less fungible term deposits that earn a higher rate of remuneration, a development that started only recently in the current hiking cycle (Slide 11, right-hand side)', 'However, even if funding became more stable again over time, banks would be likely to want to hold larger liquidity buffers to meet potential outflows', '[16] And they would want to hold such buffers, at least in part, in central bank reserves as these do not need to be liquidated and, unlike marketable safe and liquid assets, are not subject to valuation changes', 'The current environment vividly demonstrates that such valuation changes can be a source of instability for banks and markets', 'Steering interest rates when the demand for reserves is uncertain These developments do not necessarily suggest that a return to the pre-2008 corridor framework is undesirable or infeasible', 'After all, reserve demand may become more predictable over time and balance sheet run-down will increase the availability of marketable HQLA which banks can use to comply with their regulatory requirements', 'But they do suggest that it may have become more difficult for central banks to correctly anticipate the demand for reserves and hence to steer interest rates in a wide corridor, and that such steering would entail a higher operational burden, both for the central bank and the banking system at large, with the need for more frequent fine-tuning operations', 'What, then, might be the alternatives to the pre-2008 corridor framework', 'The recent experience of other major central banks suggests that policymakers have two broad options: one is to formally adopt the current floor system by maintaining a sufficiently large bond portfolio on the asset side; the other is to offer, either in a floor or a narrow-corridor framework, regular collateralised lending operations that ensure that banks are able to maintain their desired level of reserve holdings as balance sheet reduction proceeds', 'While both options can be expected to have a similar capacity to maintain control over overnight interest rates, they differ in their impact on the size and composition of the central bank’s balance sheet, and in their ability to deal with the idiosyncratic features of the Eurosystem', 'More liquidity than needed, but not necessarily enough The first option is broadly how the Federal Reserve manages its balance sheet', '[17]  The Federal Reserve aims to keep a sufficiently large buffer of excess reserves in the system so that the effective federal funds rate – the rate at which banks and certain other institutions lend to each other – trades close to the interest rate paid on reserve balances', 'This is the “floor” below which banks are better off depositing with the Federal Reserve than lending in the market (Slide 12)', 'As not all financial market participants have access to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the floor might be “leaky” – that is, overnight interest rates might trade below the floor as banks charge an intermediation spread when borrowing reserves from non-banks that cannot directly store funds with the central bank', '[18]  The bargaining power of non-banks can be increased by giving them access to the central banks’ balance sheet', 'This is what the Federal Reserve has achieved by establishing the overnight reverse repo facility (ON RRP) which remunerates cash held by selected non-banks at rates slightly below the one paid to banks', 'This facility therefore sets a second floor on money market rates, reducing their volatility', '[19]  Operating a floor system like that of the Federal Reserve has three key benefits: first, it maintains a higher level of safe assets in the financial system; second, it is operationally simple, especially in a context where it may be hard to accurately forecast the demand for reserves; and third, it can ensure instrument robustness – that is, it can cater for large changes in the supply of reserves without diluting the interest rate signal', '[20]  The degree of rate controllability under this framework depends, however, on a number of structural features of the economy', 'These features, in turn, raise trade-offs, which may be larger in the euro area than elsewhere', 'One trade-off arises when central banks expand their balance sheets', 'For example, the large increase in reserves in the wake of the PEPP and TLTROs has made the floor in the euro area more and more leaky, with the euro area’s benchmark interest rate, €STR, increasingly decoupling from the DFR (Slide 13)', 'In these circumstances, interest rate control could be improved by broadening access to the deposit facility, in ways similar to the ON RRP', 'Doing so could, however, affect the calculation of benchmark rates in the euro area', 'An ample reserve system disintermediates the unsecured money market, so that the computation of €STR heavily relies on banks’ trading with market participants who have no access to the Eurosystem’s balance sheet', 'At the end of last year, for example, borrowing from non-banks accounted for nearly 90% of all unsecured money market transactions (Slide 14)', 'We would therefore need to find ways to safeguard continued robustness of €STR, while, at the same time, avoiding destabilising shifts in funds between banks and non-banks which could occur when broadening the access to our balance sheet', 'A second trade-off arises when the supply of reserves declines', 'Because the distribution of excess liquidity is often highly uneven across banks, reserve scarcity in corners of the financial system might put upward pressure on interest rates even at high levels of aggregate excess reserves', 'In the euro area, for example, 25 banks alone currently hold over 40% of excess liquidity, with little changes over time (Slide 15, left-hand side)', 'Moreover, excess liquidity tends to be concentrated in countries that are financial centres (Slide 15, right-hand side)', 'The uneven distribution of reserves within the system, together with the large uncertainty about banks’ underlying liquidity preferences, imply that central banks may have to keep a significant buffer of excess reserves in the financial system to avoid unwarranted interest rate volatility', 'To provide ample reserves in this framework, the central bank is required, by and large, to maintain a significant outright “structural” bond portfolio', 'The Fed’s approach is therefore called a “supply-driven” floor system', 'It constrains the choices of the central bank as to how to provide the reserves required to effectively steer overnight rates towards the floor', 'An attempt to allow banks to choose their desired level of reserves, using credit operations, could risk undersupplying the system as a whole, that is leaving it without the required volume of excess reserves', 'In principle, policymakers are free to choose the broad characteristics of such a structural bond portfolio', 'For example, central banks could adjust the asset composition according to their secondary objectives, such as alignment with the Paris Agreement', '[21]  Moreover, the average weighted maturity could be kept short to limit the impact of the portfolio on the monetary policy stance or to reduce central banks’ exposure to duration risk', 'In the euro area, however, there are two additional considerations relevant for the assessment of whether a large bond portfolio is desirable or not', 'One is that the lack of a consolidated public sector balance sheet raises more fundamental concerns about monetary and fiscal interactions in a currency union with sovereign member states', 'These concerns may potentially undermine the credibility and independence of the central bank', 'If central banks need to raise interest rates sharply to protect price stability, this implies significant risk exposures for central banks and may have implications for government budgets', '[22] In addition, large central bank’s sovereign bond holdings may distort the price information of underlying risks in the euro area', 'Second, a large bond portfolio may affect liquidity conditions in financial markets', 'In recent years, the Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets has contributed to a significant “scarcity premium” that market participants must pay to obtain bonds bought under our asset purchase programmes (Slide 16, left-hand side)', 'Such scarcity effects can put the smooth functioning of financial markets at risk, especially when the demand for safe assets increases in periods of stress', 'These effects tend to be larger in the euro area than in the United States, given the euro area’s substantially lower volume of outstanding highly-rated and liquid bonds (Slide 16, right-hand side)', 'Central banks have tools to partly alleviate such distortionary effects', 'The Eurosystem’s securities lending facility, for example, channels bonds bought under our purchase programmes back into the market, improving liquidity', 'But the larger the portfolio, the less likely it is that liquidity conditions remain unaffected', 'This could risk undermining our obligation to act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy where prices and quantities are determined by competitive market forces', '[23]  Giving banks the liquidity they demand The second approach has the potential to alleviate some of these trade-offs by allowing banks themselves to determine the amount of liquidity they want to hold', 'This is broadly the approach the Bank of England first announced in 2019 and implemented in 2022', \"[24]  Under this approach, the central bank offers regular collateralised lending operations to ensure that any shortfall in banks' demand for reserves is replenished as quantitative tightening proceeds (Slide 17)\", 'That is why the Bank of England’s approach is referred to as a “demand-driven” floor system', 'In doing so, the Bank of England can unwind its bond holdings without needing to know banks’ demand for excess reserves, nor the point at which the supply curve will start to cross the steep part of the demand curve', 'The Bank of England currently offers reserves through short-term repo operations at the same rate that it pays to banks depositing reserves', 'Using the same rate for providing and remunerating reserves ensures that money market rates will trade closely to the policy rate at every level of excess reserves', 'By its nature, such a system shares some of the benefits and costs of a supply-driven framework', 'While it is operationally simple and robust to large changes in reserves, it may in some market structures also be prone to a leaky floor when excess reserves expand measurably in response to asset purchases or long-term credit operations', '[25]  In addition, a demand-driven framework has two specific characteristics', 'One is that its success in steering interest rates critically depends on banks’ willingness to regularly tap the lending operations as and when they begin to experience shortfalls relative to their reserves demand', 'Stigma may prevent banks from borrowing the amount needed to stabilise interest rates at the intended level', 'In the United Kingdom, this risk has been tackled in three ways: first, through non-penal pricing; second, by communicating clearly that this is a business-as-usual monetary policy operation; and third, through a clear statement from the Prudential Regulation Authority that it would judge usage of the facility to be routine participation in money markets', 'A second characteristic is a potential “coordination” problem: individually, banks may have incentives to be economical in their borrowing of reserves, which could expose them to unexpected liquidity shocks in-between liquidity providing operations', 'So, in the absence of an efficient interbank market, there must be alternative facilities for banks to source liquidity at short notice should they need it', 'The Bank of England offers a range of liquidity facilities which allow firms to access reliable supplies of liquidity at a predictable cost', 'Provided these issues can be resolved, the Bank of England’s approach has a number of benefits that may be particularly relevant for a large and heterogeneous currency area like the euro area', 'One is that it may provide better insurance against potential fragmentation shocks', 'Under a demand-driven framework, the distribution of reserves would be expected to be more even than in a supply-driven floor system, where excess reserves are often very concentrated (Slide 15)', 'A more balanced reserve distribution could strengthen the resilience of the currency union', 'A second benefit of a demand-driven framework is that it offers more flexibility on how the central bank provides reserves: because only the marginal unit of reserves to the banking system must be supplied via credit operations, the central bank may still choose to hold an outright bond portfolio, for example to satisfy the economy’s structural liquidity needs', 'This portfolio could be appreciably smaller than what may be required to steer interest rates in a supply-driven framework', 'It could nevertheless be useful in reducing the operational burden and in avoiding encumbering large volumes of collateral', '[26]  A third benefit is that the Bank of England’s approach may potentially lead to a leaner balance sheet depending on banks’ demand for reserves, which will depend, among other things, on two factors', 'One is central banks’ collateral framework: all else being equal, the easier it is for counterparties to turn non-HQLA into highly liquid reserves, the larger the central bank’s balance sheet will be', 'The other factor is the relative return on reserves', 'For a long time, reserves in the euro area have been an attractive option for complying with HQLA requirements', 'They persistently generated higher returns than safe and liquid bonds (Slide 18)', 'The rise in policy rates has made the relative returns on reserves much more volatile', 'In recent months, it was often more profitable for banks to hold marketable HQLA', 'This was also typically the norm when excess reserves were scarce', 'A final and important benefit of a demand-driven framework is that it allows the central bank to gradually learn about banks’ underlying liquidity preferences', 'This offers some flexibility for adjustment in the future', 'For example, although the Bank of England currently operates a floor framework, this is not a necessary feature for the success of a demand-driven system', 'Sveriges Riksbank, for example, operates in a narrow corridor system where the lending rate and the deposit facility rate are set at a spread of 10 basis points above and below the policy rate', 'This spread was chosen to encourage counterparties to find market solutions for their funding needs rather than making recourse to the central bank', '[27]  If the corridor is sufficiently narrow, the implied rate volatility from fluctuations in aggregate excess reserves may not be a first-order concern', 'Indeed, the experience of the Eurosystem in 2014, when excess liquidity was declining, suggests that even relatively large fluctuations in overnight rates might not affect broader policy transmission (Slide 19)', 'Conclusion To conclude, my remarks today have highlighted that the decision which policy implementation framework the ECB should choose for the future involves many complex issues', 'Ultimately, our obligation to act in line with the principle of an open market economy implies that, in the steady state,  the size of our balance sheet should only be as large as necessary to ensure sufficient liquidity provision and effectively steer short-term interest rates towards levels that are consistent with price stability over the medium term', 'Thank you', 'I would like to thank staff from the ECB’s Directorate General Market Operations for their contributions to this speech', 'For the rationale and market impact of quantitative

      " list(['I', 'Introduction     Ladies and Gentlemen,  On behalf of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, I would like to welcome you to this press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the second edition of the ECB’s report on “Financial Integration in Europe”', 'The first report on “Financial integration in Europe” was published last year and we intend to release it annually', 'Its main purpose is to contribute towards the advancement of European financial integration and to raise public awareness of the Eurosystem’s role in supporting the financial integration process', 'Before I turn to the content of the report, let me briefly recall why we prepare and publish this report', 'The Eurosystem has a strong interest in the integration and the efficient functioning of the financial system in Europe, particularly in the euro area, because it facilitates the performance of our core tasks', 'Starting with monetary policy, a well-integrated financial system facilitates the transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area', 'Financial integration is also highly relevant to the Eurosystem’s role in safeguarding the stability of the financial system', 'More integrated financial markets enhance the opportunities for sharing and diversifying risk and increase the market liquidity', 'At the same time, a more closely integrated financial system also raises the scope for spill-over effects and contagion across borders, as the recent financial market turmoil has manifested', 'Financial integration is also fundamental to our task of promoting the smooth operation of payment systems and of securities clearing and settlement systems', 'Finally, without prejudice to our primary objective of price stability, we support the general economic policies of the European Union', 'The completion of a single market for capital and financial services is an important policy priority which should foster the efficiency and development of the European financial system and help increase potential growth', 'The ECB and the entire Eurosystem fully support the efforts of the private sector and the EU institutions to enhance the integration and development of the European financial system', 'In this respect, the ECB works very closely with the European Commission, which has a primary responsibility in this field', 'The ECB report complements the work of the Commission in this area', 'I now turn to the content of the report and will highlight some of the main findings', 'The report consists of three chapters [see slide 2]', 'The first chapter sets out the ECB’s assessment of the state of financial integration in the euro area', 'This assessment is based on a set of quantitative indicators we have developed', 'The second chapter contains in-depth analyses of selected issues relating to financial integration', 'The final chapter of the report gives an overview of the activities of the Eurosystem in 2007 aimed at advancing the integration and development of financial markets in Europe', 'II', 'The state of financial integration in Europe    Let me start with the ECB’s assessment of the state of financial integration in the euro area which covers the money, bond, equity and banking markets, as well as the underlying market infrastructures', 'The tables on this slide [see slide 3] and on the following one summarise our assessment of the degree of integration in the various market segments', 'Two key facts should be highlighted: first, financial integration is generally more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy; and, second, it depends on the degree of integration of the respective market infrastructures', 'These conclusions confirm the findings of last year’s report', 'In particular, the unsecured money market has been fully integrated since the introduction of the euro, and the repo market is also highly integrated', 'The full integration of the large-value payment systems has been instrumental in achieving this result', 'Government bond markets have also become considerably integrated', 'Similarly, the corporate bond market received a major boost with the introduction of the euro and has subsequently achieved a high degree of integration', 'Some progress has also been made in the integration of euro area equity markets, although the euro area securities infrastructure that underpins both bond and equity markets is not yet sufficiently integrated', 'However, efforts to reduce these barriers are currently under way', 'Turning to the banking markets [see slide 4], integration has advanced well in the fields of wholesale banking and capital-market activities', 'The integration of the retail banking market has, however, been slow and hampered by the fragmentation of the European payment systems', 'After this broad overview, allow me to illustrate some specific developments in particular market segments, also with reference to the recent episode of financial turbulence', 'In this context, a pertinent question is whether the financial market turmoil has had an impact on the degree of integration in various market segments', 'First, with regard to the nearly fully integrated money markets, the recent financial turmoil has undoubtedly left a mark on the cross-country standard deviation of the unsecured interbank lending rates, as you can see from this chart [see slide 5]', 'Looking at this graph, one may wonder whether the turmoil has in fact led to a higher segmentation, and therefore, less integration, in the market', 'In response, let me now show you a related indicator for the secured money market which strongly suggests that this is not likely to be the case', 'As you see in the chart [see slide 6], the cross-country standard deviation of the interbank repo rates does not seem to have been similarly affected', 'As credit risk is an important element in the unsecured markets, but not so in the secured markets, this may lead us to conclude that the increase in differences in credit risk across institutions, rather than increased segmentation, is the likely explanation for the observed small but noticeable increase in the cross-country standard deviation in interbank lending rates', 'Of course, we continue to monitor the evolution of these and other indicators very closely in the coming months in order to obtain more information on the possible effects of the turmoil on the money markets as well as on other financial markets', 'I already mentioned that retail banking markets continue to be less integrated than other banking market segments', 'The dispersion of total assets of euro area bank branches and subsidiaries across euro area countries illustrates the point [see slide 7]', 'The horizontal line within the pillars shows the median share of assets for both types of establishments', 'Whereas the median share of assets of foreign subsidiaries increased to 14', '4% last year, the median share of assets of foreign branches slightly decreased, reaching 2', '0%', 'III Special features    The second chapter of the report contains four “Special Features”', 'These are in-depth assessments of policy issues relating to financial integration that are of particular relevance to the Eurosystem’s tasks [see slide 8]', 'This year, we selected the following topics: (1) concepts and measures of financial development; (2) the STEP initiative; (3) the integration and development of mortgage markets; and (4) the integration of large-value payment and securities transactions', 'Out of these four, I should like to focus on two, namely on financial development and on the integration of mortgage markets', 'III', '1', 'Financial Development    The special feature on financial development goes beyond financial integration and looks into other elements that affect the performance of the financial system [see slide 9]', 'The concept of financial development is introduced and is related to other concepts such as financial integration, efficiency and stability', 'More precisely, financial development refers to the process of financial innovation, institutional and organisational improvements that reduce asymmetric information, increase the completeness of markets and contracting possibilities, lower transaction costs, and enhance competition', 'In particular, financial development is complementary to financial integration in reducing market frictions and fostering financial market efficiency', 'This chart [see slide 10] presents a simple framework to summarise the determinants of the performance of the financial system and its links to the performance of the broader economy', 'There are three levels of analysis', 'The first level concerns the fundamentals of the financial system that do not change very fast, such as legal and regulatory frameworks or features of the economy’s financial structure', 'The second level relates to the performance of the financial system, that is, its efficiency and stability', 'The third level focuses on the performance of the economy as a whole, that is, economic growth and price stability', 'As you can see, financial integration and financial development are processes that influence the relationship between the fundamentals of the financial system and its performance', 'A selection of indicators is provided in this Special Feature to monitor financial development and efficiency [see slide 11]', 'These indicators can be grouped into general and market-specific indicators', 'An example of general indicators is the size of capital markets, which aggregates the sizes of stock, bond and loan markets, as a percentage of GDP', 'On average, euro area capital markets tend to be smaller than those in the United Kingdom and the United States', 'Let me continue with some examples of market-specific indicators', 'This chart [see slide 12] shows the notional amounts of nominal outstanding interest rate derivatives, that is, forward rate agreements, options, and swaps, by currency', 'By using derivatives, market participants can better manage risks, lock in the future price of the underlying assets and even alter the terms of the underlying financial contract', 'As a consequence, the allocation of capital and risk across time and space is improved', 'The chart clearly shows that the most active interest rate derivative markets are those denominated in euro and in the US dollar, with outstanding amounts in 2006 of 86 and 75 trillion euro, respectively', 'Focusing on the evolution of the interest rate derivatives market over time, this chart [see slide 13] shows that the US-dollar denominated interest rate derivatives grew the fastest, with the amount outstanding increasing sixfold', 'The second fastest growing markets were the interest rate derivatives denominated in euro and in pound sterling, which both quadrupled from 1999 to 2006', 'Securitisation of illiquid bank assets is a form of financial innovation that has expanded substantially in recent years', 'This chart [see slide 14] shows the extent of off-balance sheet securitisation via asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities relative to gross domestic product (GDP), using the location of the underlying collateral to link this financial innovation to countries', 'According to this indicator, the United States is by far the most active market for securitising mortgages and receivables such as car loans or credit card loans: the volume of issuance amounted to 25% of GDP', 'In the euro area, the average volume of issuance was only 2% of the GDP, with Spain, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Ireland and Portugal having the highest levels', 'The lack of integration in European mortgage markets partly explains these facts', 'It also suggests that the ease with which issuers of asset-backed securities in one country can include illiquid assets from other European countries is an important factor that will influence the evolution of securitisation in Europe', 'Another example of a market-specific indicator of financial development is the total amount of venture capital financing as a share of GDP [see slide 15]', 'Despite having grown substantially over the past ten years, venture capital financing remains only a fraction of the UK and US figures in most euro area countries, with the exception of Finland', 'To sum up, on the basis of the indicators identified so far, it can be concluded that there still exists a fair degree of heterogeneity in financial development across markets and countries in the euro area', 'On average, the euro area financial system compares well to a group of benchmark countries, except perhaps relative to the United Kingdom and the United States, which perform better on the basis of most of the indicators presented in the report', 'There is certainly room for further analysis and assessment of financial development by enhancing the existing indicators and by identifying new ones', 'And there is room for structural reforms that can foster financial market efficiency', 'III', '2 The Short-Term European Paper (STEP) initiative    The second Special Feature, entitled “The STEP initiative”, describes how the ECB and the Eurosystem can act as a catalyst for private sector activities and, in this way, promote financial integration in the euro area [see slide 17]', 'The Short-Term European Paper (STEP) initiative to develop a pan-European short-term paper market originated from the observation that the short-term securities market had been the least integrated money market segment since the introduction of the euro', 'The STEP label, given to issuance programmes that comply with a core set of commonly agreed market standards and practices, provides market participants across the euro area with a common framework', 'Since its launch in 2006, the STEP initiative has already yielded significant progress in market integration and transparency', 'III', '3 Mortgage markets in Europe    The third special feature of the Report on which I will elaborate, given its topicality, concerns the integration and development of mortgage markets in Europe', 'Mortgage markets are an important part of the euro area financial system: the provision of mortgage loans is a key financial service for households; mortgages accounted for almost 30% of total bank loans and about 60% of the household liabilities; and asset-backed securities – of which mortgage-backed securities represent a large share – have become an important source of collateral, accounting for approximately 16% of all collateral deposited with the Eurosystem, a slightly larger fraction than central government bonds', 'Mortgage markets are very important, yet they remain one of the least integrated financial markets in Europe and progress towards further integration has been slow', 'This is partly due to natural barriers, such as language, affinity and consumer preferences', 'However, other factors such as domestic infrastructures and differing legal and consumer protection frameworks create barriers that can, and should, be addressed by policy-makers and market participants', 'The chart on slide 19 on new housing loans in euro area countries, classified by the period of interest rate fixation, illustrates the diversity in the mortgage lending markets', 'In general, not only the use of fixed and variable rate mortgages, but also early repayment and prepayment options and loan maturities vary considerably across the euro area', 'Similarly, diversity prevails on the funding side of mortgage markets', 'The chart on slide 20 illustrates the relative importance of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs) and covered bonds in the national markets', 'The dominance of only one type of instrument in most countries is related to the presence of long-established legal frameworks, or the existence of certain legal or other obstacles', 'Consequently, there seems to be room to improve the availability of different mortgage funding instruments in euro area countries as well as in other EU countries', 'This Special Feature examines in considerable detail the potential implications of further integration in European mortgage markets for the monetary policy transmission mechanism and for financial stability', 'Overall, the Eurosystem’s assessment is that further integration of mortgage markets is desirable because it is likely to bring about a more uniform transmission of monetary impulses and a more stable financial system as a result of improved risk diversification [see slide 21]', 'At the same time, the process of financial integration may entail certain risks to monetary and financial stability, such as increased vulnerability of domestic financial systems to external shocks and intense competition that may lead to an erosion of credit standards', 'So while we strongly support further integration in mortgage markets, we are also of the view that this process should be carefully monitored', 'That said, full integration of mortgage markets is a process that is likely to take many years and will largely be driven by market forces [see slide 22]', 'We believe that market participants’ actions will help achieve significant further progress', 'For example, they can increase market transparency, improve statistics, promote standardised mortgage products and develop market benchmarks', 'Within the scope of its competencies, the ECB stands ready to support such market initiatives, as we have done in the area of short-term securities', 'III', '4 Integration of large-value payment and securities transactions: TARGET2, T2S, CCBM2    The final Special Feature, entitled “Integration of large-value payment and securities transactions: TARGET2, TARGET2-Securities and CCBM2”, considers the advances towards an integrated and well-functioning European market infrastructure, focusing on the contribution of the Eurosystem [see slide\\xa023]', 'During the run-up to the introduction of the euro, the Eurosystem established the TARGET system and the Correspondent Central Banking Model (CCBM) which enabled the area-wide settlement of large-value transactions in central bank money and the cross-border delivery of collateral to the Eurosystem', 'While these were undoubtedly already major steps towards the integration of crucial market infrastructures, TARGET and CCBM did not yet allow market participants to manage their cash, collateral and securities positions in an integrated way', 'The recent establishment of TARGET2 as a centralised technical service addresses this shortcoming for euro-denominated large-value and urgent payments', 'It also enables the move towards a fully integrated infrastructure in the fields of securities settlement, liquidity and collateral management', 'The envisaged TARGET2-Securities project and the Collateral Central Bank Management (CCBM2) facilities, together with TARGET 2, are “second generation” services, which represent a quantum leap forward in the integration and quality of the euro area core infrastructure, with substantial benefits for financial market integration', 'IV', 'Eurosystem activities to promote financial integration    I now turn to the report’s third chapter, titled “Eurosystem activities for financial integration”', 'It provides an overview of the main Eurosystem activities in 2007', 'The ECB and the Eurosystem contributed to financial integration and development in a number of ways, building on their expertise and special nature as public institutions which are both active in the market and have close interaction with market participants', 'We distinguish between four types of activities [see slide\\xa024]', 'First, we give advice on the legislative and regulatory framework for the financial system and make rules', 'A good example is the Eurosystem’s contribution to the first full review of the Lamfalussy framework last year', 'The Eurosystem reiterated its support to the Lamfalussy framework subject to some necessary functional enhancements within the current institutional framework and in particular emphasised the need for intensification of cooperation and information-sharing between supervisors and central banks', 'Second, we seek to act as catalysts for private sector activities', 'In this regard, we have been instrumental in the success of the short-term European paper, or STEP, initiative', 'This initiative aims to promote the integration of short-term paper market through the voluntary compliance of market players with a core set of standards', 'The outstanding amount of euro-denominated STEP-labelled securities already accounts for about 30% of all euro-denominated short-term paper placed by non-government issuers worldwide', 'Third, we enhance knowledge, raise awareness and monitor the state of European financial integration', 'This Report, and the indicators of financial integration that are presented here, are an illustrative example of this type of activity', 'Fourth, we provide central bank services that also foster European financial integration', 'As an example, I choose our wholesale payment system, TARGET2', 'The successful launch of this single technical platform in November last year marks a significant milestone in financial integration', 'TARGET2, replacing TARGET, provides for a harmonised service level, a single price structure, and a harmonised set of cash settlement services in central bank money for all “ancillary” systems, such as retail payment systems, clearing houses and securities settlement systems', 'All central banks and TARGET users will have migrated to TARGET2 by 19 May this year', 'V Concluding remarks    This brings me to the end of my presentation', 'Central banks are at the core of financial systems and therefore closely follow developments which can foster integration [see slide 25]', 'The ECB and the entire Eurosystem devote a substantial amount of resources to this task, because we are convinced that progress in this area is important for the European economy, within the framework established by the Lisbon agenda', 'Finally, I should also like to stress that, while financial integration is an important driver for increasing the efficiency of a financial system, financial efficiency also depends on financial development', 'Therefore, future reports are envisaged to encompass analysis and assessment of the various factors determining the efficient functioning of the financial system', 'The special feature on financial development that I presented is a first step in this direction', 'Thank you very much for your attention', 'I am now at your disposal for questions', 'SEE ALSO  Find out more about related content   Annexes Slides from the presentation   Publications Financial integration in Europe,

wenigen Jahrzehnten wäre eine einheitliche Währung in Europa für viele Beobachter undenkbar gewesen', 'Und doch feierten wir, wie Sie wissen, vor Kurzem das zehnjährige Bestehen der EZB und somit auch des ESZB, des Europäischen Systems der Zentralbanken', 'Seit der Einführung des Euro im Januar\\xa01999 konzentriert sich die EZB auf die Gewährleistung der Preisstabilität im Euroraum, ihr vorrangiges Ziel', 'Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great honour and a pleasure to be invited here today to speak about the current state of the euro area and its future', 'Not many decades ago, a single currency in Europe would have been unthinkable for many observers', 'And yet, as you know, we have just celebrated the tenth anniversary of the creation of the ECB and, for that matter, the ESCB\\xa0– the European System of Central Banks', 'Since the launch of the euro in January 1999, the ECB has focused on preserving price stability in the euro area, its primary objective', 'You all know very well that inflation rates have continued to rise since the autumn of last year', 'Inflation is expected to remain above the level consistent with price stability for longer than we previously thought', 'Last week we had to act to discourage second-round effects and to counteract the increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term', 'Our decision will contribute to delivering price stability over the medium term', 'As I will argue in my talk today, a lot depends on the solidly anchoring of inflation expectations', 'Over the last ten years, the ECB has gained a great deal of respect and credibility', 'Since the launch of the euro, the average inflation rate has been just slightly above 2%', 'And this has been achieved, despite various shocks that have hit the euro area over these years, including the ongoing strong global increase in commodity prices that is affecting Europe and the rest of the world', 'In the decades before the launch of the euro, average annual inflation rates in many EU Member States were very significantly higher', 'This is a remarkable result', 'It shows that we have inherited the credibility that was the privilege of the most successful currencies before the euro', 'Today, I would like to share with you some of our achievements over these past ten momentous years', 'They call for celebration', 'But over and beyond our performance in terms of price stability, I would also like to share with you reflections on the economic performance of the euro area and some of the remaining challenges that the ECB and the euro area as a whole face as they enter their second decade', 'I will then make a few remarks on the sound economic management of our Monetary Union', '1', 'On the achievements of the euro area    The new monetary policy framework – with the ECB setting the monetary policy for the entire euro area – was quickly understood and trusted from the very first days', 'The ECB has a clear mandate – to safeguard price stability in the euro area – and is independent', 'In 2003, the ECB clarified that price stability meant maintaining inflation rates close to and below 2% over the medium term', 'This is a clear yardstick against which the public can judge us', 'While being custodian of the trust of the citizens of the euro area, we are also fully accountable to them, and endeavour to explain our actions', 'Over these ten years, this framework has contributed to anchoring longer-term inflation expectations', 'We all know that price stability is essential for the success of a large economic and monetary union', 'It protects the incomes of all of us, and particularly those of the most vulnerable and poorest of our fellow citizens', 'An aspect that is often neglected is that, thanks to price stability, diverse other benefits follow', 'Price stability is a precondition for sustainable growth and job creation and, ultimately, social cohesion', '[1] It is also a major contribution for financial stability', 'The euro also promotes the functioning of our vast continental market and, therefore, helps bring about a true single market for goods, services, capital and labour', 'During the first nine years of the euro, 15', '7 million new jobs were created in the euro area, and the unemployment rate is now at the lowest level since the early 1980s', 'Our common currency has also helped to protect the euro area economy from diverse global shocks, as well as from the considerable turbulence of the last few years', 'Let me offer you two examples of the credibility of the ECB and the benefits that this brings', 'Over recent months, we have seen that actual inflation may temporarily diverge from our medium-term objective', 'The  first example  of the credibility of the ECB is that long-term inflation expectations have remained solidly anchored', 'In fact, they have remained well anchored over the entire ten years', 'This is remarkable considering the series of adverse economic disturbances that have hit the euro area since its inception', 'The  second example  of the credibility of the ECB is that medium and long-term market rates of the euro are at the same low levels in terms of embedded inflation expectations and risk premia as those experienced by the most stable national currencies prior to it', 'In other words, we have been instrumental in securing the lowest market interest rates on a 5, 10 up to 50-year basis', 'Most euro area countries have benefited from significantly better financing conditions than in the 1990s, a situation which has also supported fiscal consolidation', '[2]     The euro has also helped strengthen trade and financial linkages across euro area countries', 'There is clear evidence that the introduction of the single currency and the associated increase in price and cost transparency have fostered both intra and extra-euro area trade in goods and services', 'In fact, the sum of intra-euro area exports and imports increased from about 31% of GDP in 1998 to around 40% in 2007 – approximately 9 percentage points', 'During the same period, extra-euro area trade growth even exceeded that in intra-euro area trade, rising 13 percentage points from 31% to 44% of GDP in 2007', 'Hence, there is no “fortress Europe”', 'Let me also mention that, when I travel around Europe, I feel that a shift in mindset is gradually taking place', 'In fact,  firms  are becoming more conscious of the euro area dimension of their actions and decisions', 'Households  are increasingly conscious of the opportunities offered by an expanded economic and financial area', 'The launch of the euro has also coincided with a remarkable deepening of financial integration', 'The financial landscape has already changed a great deal in most market segments, and is continuing to change', 'The euro is acting as a catalyst for a gradual portfolio reallocation away from holdings of domestic financial instruments towards holdings of financial instruments issued elsewhere within the euro area', 'For instance, euro area cross-border holdings of long-term debt securities have increased strongly – from about 10% of total stocks at the end of the 1990s to nearly 60% in 2006', 'Furthermore, euro area residents almost doubled the amount of cross-border holdings of equity issued by euro area residents, from 15% to 29%, between 1997 and 2006, in particular on account of institutional investors', 'As for capital flows, the euro has boosted foreign direct investment – particularly cross-border mergers and acquisitions in manufacturing – and portfolio flows across euro area countries', 'Well-integrated financial markets and diversified portfolios reduce the extent to which the saving and spending decisions of firms and households are dependent on economic and financial developments in a specific country, region or sector', 'As a result, credit and risk-sharing channels are increasingly helping to attenuate the impact of shocks in a specific euro area country or sector', 'Let me mention also one important aspect', 'We live in an era of rapid technological progress', 'Competitive forces are reshaping global manufacturing, the financial landscape and the sharing of wealth', 'Large demographic changes are also under way', 'The impact of these “mega-trends” is very substantial, although it is difficult to quantify them precisely', 'In my view, the euro area as a whole has exhibited resilience to such external developments', 'It is, as a whole, significantly more resilient than many of its individual member countries were before the launch of the euro [3]', 'The euro area has been a source of stability', 'In short, the current state of the euro area is one of increasing interdependence and ongoing integration', 'Over these ten years, we have observed greater price stability, greater macroeconomic stability, as well as increasing economic and financial integration', 'However, despite these achievements, there is no room for complacency, and a great deal still needs to be accomplished', 'I now want to put forward the argument that several changes in this second decade and beyond will have to come from the “E” in EMU: namely that there is a need for further substantial efforts and reforms on the economic side', 'In other words, I argue that there is a need for a sound economic management', 'This has two facets', 'The first is that the overall level of economic performance in the euro area needs to improve', 'Think, for example, of the question as to how the euro area as a whole might raise its potential growth…and actually grow at such a higher level', 'The second facet is that we need to understand and address diversity of economic performance across the euro area', 'Think, for example, of the question as to the extent to which euro area countries differ in terms of economic performance', 'I will deal with these aspects in turn', '2', 'On the economic performance of the euro area    The achievements I have just described have accompanied an impressive performance in terms of job creation', 'From the start of EMU to the end of last year, as I have already mentioned, the number of people in employment in the euro area has increased by 15', '7 million, compared with an increase of only some 5 million in the previous nine years, and the euro area unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since the early 1980s', 'Of course, the surge in employment cannot be attributed solely to the euro', 'It also reflects corporate restructuring, the progress made on structural reforms and overall wage moderation in most countries', 'However, Europe is far from having exhausted its potential for further increases in labour participation rates and employment', 'Let me flag just a few facts', 'The overall employment rate in the euro area remains modest by international standards – 65', '7% in the euro area, compared with 72% in the United States – and the unemployment rate is still clearly too high – over 7% in the euro area', 'More specifically, while the employment rate of prime-age men in the euro area is comparable with that in the United States, considerable disparities remain when we look at employment rates among the young, among women and among older workers', '[4]  Labour market reforms appear to be even more appropriate if we consider that growth performance will increasingly be constrained by relatively low population growth rates and population ageing', 'Since the early 1990s, the population of the euro area has been growing at a yearly rate of only 0', '4%, compared with 1', '1% in the United States', 'Europe has room to develop its growth potential', 'Since the early 1990s, real GDP has grown, on average, by 2', '1% in the euro area, compared with 2', '8% in the United States', 'Since the start of EMU, the annual growth rate for the euro area has averaged 2', '2% per year, compared with 2', '7% in the United States', 'Even if one has to recognise that the euro area did slightly better than the US in terms of GDP growth per capita, it remains that the euro area’s potential output growth has moved to the lower bound of its previously estimated range of 2-2', '5%', 'A low trend growth in labour productivity explains, in large part, the modest growth performance', 'During the 1980s, hourly labour productivity in the euro area grew, on average, by 2', '3%, while it declined to 1', '8% in the 1990s and decreased further to 1', '2% between 1999 and 2007', 'By contrast, hourly labour productivity growth in the United States accelerated from 1', '2% to 1', '6% and then to 2', '1% over the same periods', '[5]   What can be done to enhance labour productivity', 'In recent years, we have seen rising levels of employment, particularly in the unskilled segment of the labour market', 'This has certainly contributed to the slowdown in labour productivity growth', 'However, to a large extent, there has also been a significant slowdown in total factor productivity (TFP) growth', 'TFP growth is generally taken as a measure of technological progress and improvement in the organisation and overall efficiency of production', '[6] There are many factors behind the low growth in TFP', 'Unfortunately, most European economies do not incorporate appropriate incentives to invest in real and human capital, to innovate and raise the flexibility and adaptability of firms when their environment changes', '[7]   To sum up, the remarkable labour market performance observed in the euro area since its creation could even be improved upon', 'Rising productivity must also contribute to enhancing the overall economic performance of the euro area as a whole', 'While the ECB sets monetary policy by looking at the performance of the euro area as a whole, the ECB also follows closely what happens in all euro area countries', 'In other words, we also look at diversity of economic performance across the euro area', '3', 'Diversity in EMU    Some diversity – in economic and financial developments – is a natural phenomenon in any vast currency area', '[8] Rates of economic growth, inflation and changes in labour costs can differ across countries for various reasons', 'Some of these reasons may have no link whatsoever with monetary policy or a single currency', 'For instance, diversity might originate from country-specific demographic trends or from their catching-up in terms of living standards', 'There could also be national differences in areas such as industry characteristics, investment in research and development (R&D), and innovation', 'Differences in the timing and extent of past structural reforms in euro area countries are also a source of diversity', '[9]  Differences in fiscal policies and other national policies can also give rise to diverse economic situations', 'There is an additional source of diversity due to the one-off shock constituted by the launch of the euro that may currently be working its way through the system', 'Some countries suddenly benefited from lower short and long-term interest rates, as well as from easier access to more competitive credit markets', 'This encouraged the purchase of durable and non-durable goods, as well as housing, albeit to differing extents, in the various euro area countries', 'But let’s put diversity in perspective', 'Over these ten years, the degree of diversity observed in the euro area at each point in time did not appear to be substantially different from that seen in the United States', 'Nor is it substantially different from that seen within the national borders of some large economies (such as Germany, Italy and Spain)', 'However, a distinct feature of diversity in the euro area is its persistence over long periods of time', 'In other words, diversity in most euro area countries displays significant inertia', 'Let me briefly look at three types of diversity', 'a) Inflation dispersion in the euro area declined considerably in the 1980s and 1990s and is now on a par with inflation dispersion in the United States', 'To give you an example, the unweighted standard deviation of annual HICP inflation rates still stood at around 6 percentage points in late 1990, but – since the launch of the euro – this rate has broadly stabilised at around 1 percentage point', 'This dispersion level is similar to that of the 14 US metropolitan statistical areas, but is somewhat higher than that of the four US census regions', 'Hence, impressive progress has been made, and I would argue that, prima facie, inflation dispersion in the euro area is not high by international standards', 'However, inflation differentials in the euro area are very persistent; in this respect, the euro area does indeed differ from the United States', 'Most euro area countries that have exhibited higher than average inflation rates in recent years have been in this position for at least a decade', 'These include Spain and Greece', 'Similar persistence – but on the opposite side – is observed in low-inflation countries such as Germany', 'Only in some euro area countries, such as Portugal and the Netherlands, have differentials moved from being relatively high to being in line with – or even below – the euro area average', 'Such corrections are welcome, but the point is that they are slow to materialise', 'If we look at the cost side, the factors generating inflation differentials are, in most countries, primarily domestic rather than external', 'In particular, we have witnessed sustained divergence in wage developments across the euro area and smaller differences in labour productivity growth', 'These differences in the growth of labour costs have been the main sources of persistence in inflation differentials', 'Various reasons can be suggested for this', 'Varying levels of wage rigidity across the euro area, changes in profit margins, imperfect competition and associated price rigidities across countries all affect labour costs and contribute to inflation differentials', 'If we look at product groups, price dispersion has been greater in the field of services, mostly owing to the dispersion observed in wage developments across countries', 'By contrast, inflation dispersion has been relatively low for tradable non-energy industrial goods, with greater competition in tradable goods being the main reason for this', 'Products with relatively volatile prices (such as energy and food) have, on the other hand, shown high levels of dispersion across countries in terms of price changes', 'b) Output growth differentials in the euro area have remained broadly stable since the early 1970s', 'No signs of increased annual divergence were observed between 1999 and 2007', 'The average dispersion of annual real GDP growth over this period (measured as the unweighted standard deviation) was around 2 percentage points', 'This figure is very close to the average dispersion of real growth rates since the 1980s', 'By comparison, if we look across all 50 US States, the dispersion of real growth has averaged approximately 2', '5 percentage points over the last 15 years', 'When the United States is divided into the eight statistical regions, the average dispersion shrinks to around 1', '5 percentage points', 'One issue of concern, however, is the fact that within the euro area there is also a relatively high degree of persistence regarding output growth differentials', 'This is less the case in the United States', 'However, taking the United States as a benchmark only helps up to a point', 'On the one hand, the US economy is known to be more flexible than the euro area, which means that the effects of asymmetric shocks can be absorbed more easily and more quickly', 'On the other hand, the United States exhibits stronger regional specialisation than the euro area, making its regions more susceptible to specific asymmetric shocks', 'Let me now turn to the two main drivers of growth differentials in the euro area: differentials in cycles and differentials in trends', 'Differentials in cycles have declined steadily since the early 1990s', 'There is also evidence of a stronger common euro area cycle accounting for a large part of the business cycle fluctuations across euro area countries', 'Since 1999, several shocks have spread in similar ways across euro area countries', 'For example, the euro area has successfully weathered several shocks, including the bursting of the dotcom bubble, the ripple effects of the terrorist attacks of September 11, the surge in global commodity prices – particularly energy prices – and the persistence of sizeable global imbalances', 'The high degree of synchronisation in the business cycles of euro area countries is a feature unique to the euro area', 'This suggests that EU integration and, more recently, the launch of the euro – rather than global forces\\xa0– have led to smaller differences in output gaps among euro area countries', 'The picture for the second driver of dispersion – namely differentials in trends – shows more lasting differences since the beginning of the 1990s, with a gradual increase in trend growth dispersion', 'This picture also differs across euro area countries, some of which persistently exhibit trend output growth either above or below the euro area average', 'It is here that the various sources of diversity that I have mentioned play a role', 'c) Changes in cost and price competitiveness mainly reflect changes in relative unit labour costs and persistent inflation differentials', 'These demonstrate that there is significant leeway for influencing competitiveness, even in the absence of nominal exchange rate adjustments', 'To give you an idea of the magnitude of this leeway, if we consider the cumulative growth of unit labour costs for the economy as a whole between 1999 and 2007, the difference between the countries with the largest increases and those with the smallest increases was around 20 to 30%', 'This is an important phenomenon, and a close examination of the driving factors is therefore required', 'Germany, for example, has seen moderate growth in unit labour costs over an extended period, leading to a correction of the losses in competitiveness that arose in the aftermath of German reunification', 'This correction – and the corresponding sustained period of relatively low inflation – is, of course, fully justified and most welcome', 'It also shows that adjustment mechanisms in the euro area work', 'A higher degree of wage flexibility would help to accelerate such desirable adjustment processes', 'At the other extreme, some countries may, to some extent, be catching up with others’ higher living standards', 'These countries are, therefore, possibly experiencing some temporary differences in competitiveness, reflecting movement towards a new equilibrium', 'Some other sources of persistent inflation differentials, however, might not be justifiable – for example, differentials attributable to insufficient flexibility', 'In some economies, weak labour productivity growth and strong increases in nominal wages and salaries over a sustained period inevitably result in a loss of competitiveness', 'To sum up, diversity in terms of inflation and cost developments is undesirable when it reflects structural rigidities or a lack of competition', 'While we see evidence of a stronger common euro area cycle, we also see diversity in national trend growth', 'Monetary policy has a limited role in addressing such diversity', 'Changes in competitiveness are unfolding faster than was foreseen prior to the launch of the euro, which is good in some respect because it means that necessary adjustments in relative competitiveness can be more rapid', 'But it also suggests that a lucid monitoring of competitive indicators is of the essence to avoid possible rapid losses of relative competitiveness inside the euro area', '4', 'There is thus a clear need for sound economic management in EMU    The future of the euro area will rely as much on consolidating its achievement as in meeting some future challenges', 'I will argue now that the increasing interdependence among euro area economies, combined with the need to raise the level of economic performance while addressing excessive differentials in inflation, growth and competitiveness, requires sound economic management', 'Let me now stress the importance of four guiding principles in this respect', 'a) The first principle is the rigorous implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact as a prerequisite for sound fiscal policies   There are several reasons for supporting sound fiscal policies', 'They are needed, for instance, to reduce the risk of fiscal policy spillover, both into monetary policy and, more generally, across countries', 'They are also needed to enhance flexibility and adaptability', 'Sound fiscal policies create the necessary conditions for flexibility, which cushions the effects of the economic cycle through the functioning of automatic stabilisers', 'Sound fiscal policies also ensure proper incentives', 'The tax and benefit system should avoid major distortions that affect incentives to work, save, invest and innovate, thereby making fiscal policy more efficient and growth-friendly', 'Moreover, the public sector also functions as a role model as regards, for example, wages or administrative prices', '[10] Importantly, sound fiscal policies must also make provisions for the effects of population ageing', 'b) The second principle for a sound economic management pertains to the full completion of the Single Market', 'This will enhance not only competition and efficiency, but also adjustment mechanisms in the event of adverse shocks', 'We still have significant progress to make in this domain, despite the fact that the Single Market was the goal of the founding fathers of the European Union, as set out in the Treaty of Rome, and despite the fact that this 50-year endeavour was very strongly reaffirmed with the Single European Act 20 years ago', 'According to the OECD, product market regulation remains high in several euro area countries, and the level of such regulation in the euro area as a whole is considered significantly higher than in the United States', 'Let me also mention the fact that the services sector, which represents 70% of euro area GDP, is far from being fully integrated as an effective single market', 'We attach enormous importance to the full integration of financial markets, particularly because these play a decisive role in shock absorption and adjustment dynamics in a large single currency area', 'As far as cross-border labour mobility is concerned, empirical evidence suggests that it is still low in the euro area – both across countries and within countries – on account of several formal barriers across the euro area', 'This is in clear contrast to the situation in the United States, where labour mobility is considerable and greatly contributes to the adjustment process', 'Hence, more needs to be done to enhance labour mobility in Europe', 'c) The third principle for a sound economic management is the need to closely monitor the implementation of structural reforms', 'Earlier I referred to some structural factors commonly contributing to inflation and growth differentials, as well as to disappointing growth in productivity', 'These detrimental factors include pervasive price and wage rigidities, excessive labour market regulation and the imperfect competition observed in several important sectors', 'This has been recognised for quite some time', 'It is widely acknowledged that reforms are essential in order to raise factor productivity and potential output, to create new jobs, to achieve lower prices and higher real incomes, and to increase the resilience and flexibility of the economy', 'Yet, experience to date has clearly shown how difficult it is to undertake reforms in practice', '[11] We have to persist and I shall flag some specific initiatives for reform in three main areas, namely: [12]   (1) Getting more people into work: Despite impressive achievements in job creation thus far, the still relatively high unemployment rates in the euro area (as well as the low participation rates in some countries) clearly suggest there is a need to stimulate not only labour supply but also labour demand', 'As regards labour demand, there is a need to reduce labour market rigidities as they restrict wage differentiation and flexibility, and thus tend to discourage the hiring of younger and older workers, in particular', 'Progress towards greater contractual flexibility must continue to improve in several euro area countries', 'Moreover, in those European countries where competitiveness has declined, or where the unemployment rate remains high, it is important that wage increases do not fully exhaust productivity gains', 'This in order to provide incentives for firms to create additional jobs', '[13] Finally, as regards labour supply, further reforms in income tax and benefit systems would help to increase people’s incentives to work', '(2) Increasing competition: Establishing efficient and well-functioning product and service markets can boost productivity trends by enhancing the incentive to invest and innovate, supports further employment creation, reduces inflation persistence and keeps upward price pressures contained, thereby improving the adjustment capacity of countries', '“Little else than productivity growth matters in the long-run” – as Bob Solow [14] once put it', 'It is undeniable that, over the past two decades, significant progress has already been made in the context of the Single Market Programme', 'This has already yielded major benefits for European economies', '[15] However, the extension and deepening of the Single Market still remains a high priority as regards further financial market integration, the pursuit of effective competition in the energy market and the implementation of the Services Directive', '[16]   (3) Supporting an innovative environment: The reforms that I have mentioned need to be accompanied by measures supporting innovation through higher investment in research and development and policies geared towards improving human capital', 'Europe needs many new and dynamic firms that are willing to reap the benefits of opening markets and to pursue creative or innovative ventures', 'Notably, it is new and smaller firms – rather than large ones – that are the job creators', 'This requires an entrepreneur-friendly environment with less “red tape”, and easier access to the finance these firms need', 'Europe is lagging significantly behind in this field; its venture capital financing, for instance, remains only a fraction of that in the United States, relative to the size of its economy', 'We know that research and development, as well as human capital, make valuable contributions to TFP growth', 'In 2006, R&D investment relative to GDP was only 1', '9% in the euro area, compared with 2', '7% in the United States', '[17] Cooperation between universities, public sector research institutes and industry must also intensify to raise the efficiency of public R&D spending', 'Unfortunately, in several euro area countries, investment in human capital is still too low for a “knowledge-intensive” economy', 'Instead, the employability and flexibility of the labour force requires human capital to be continuously adjusted to labour market needs', 'This investment should start “early” by enhancing the quality and efficiency of our schools and universities, and be continued through lifelong training and learning', 'd) The fourth principle for a sound economic management is the need to monitor unit labour costs and national competitiveness indicators so as to prevent or correct abnormal deviations', 'We would expect some dispersion and differentials among euro area countries', 'As I have already mentioned, in such a vast area, there will always be some diversity, as in the United States', 'Countries catching up in terms of GDP per capita and price levels are always likely to have stronger output growth and higher inflation', 'Diversity may also extend to correcting past excesses in terms of overall cost and price competitiveness, particularly in the markets for tradable goods and services', 'In such situations, national governments and social partners need to take action to address excessive wage developments and to strengthen productivity growth, so that unit labour costs in those economies increase less rapidly than the euro area average', 'To sum up, this sound economic management can foster economic stability and growth, as well as reduce the impact of adverse shocks, or facilitate the adjustment thereafter', 'The attentive monitoring of economic and financial developments, and of changes in competitiveness in particular, must be an integral part of this economic management', 'The public’s understanding and acceptance of these elements is also crucial', 'That is why we always strive to explain what actions we are undertaking, and why', '*** Ladies and gentlemen, let me now conclude', 'The past ten momentous years have been rich in achievements', 'The introduction of the euro has been recognised as a remarkable success', 'Since 1999, the single currency has fully inherited the degree of credibility and confidence that was the privilege of the most credible national currencies prior to the euro', 'Inflation expectations are well anchored, and medium and long-term interest rates in the euro area are at the same low level as the levels observed for the most credible of these former national currencies', 'We also see a remarkable degree of resilience in a complex international environment', 'These achievements are a solid foundation for our future', 'But we also know that the challenges lying ahead for the euro area are still demanding', 'What do we need to do, over the next ten years and beyond, to consolidate the remarkable success of the euro and improve the performance of euro area economies', 'We, at the ECB and the Eurosystem, must preserve the quality of our monetary policy', 'This will safeguard all the benefits expected of price stability in terms of low current and expected inflation and interest rates', 'To strengthen the “E” in EMU, we need to focus on a sound economic management and we need to secure a broad base of acceptance for it', 'This entails: a rigorous implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact; the completion of the Single Market; the implementation of the structural reforms envisaged in the Lisbon agenda; and a careful monitoring of national unit labour costs and competitiveness indicators', 'The achievements that I have described and the visible benefits of the euro support this sound economic management', 'These achievements and benefits help national governments to adapt and further liberalise their economies', 'Thank you for your attention', 'Selected references    Anderton, R', ', F', 'di Mauro and F', 'Moneta,

Several studies have shown how harmful inflation (and inflation volatility) can be', 'Let me also remind you that empirical evidence shows there is a negative relationship between inflation and output growth, with a 100-basis point permanent increase in inflation being associated with a 10 to 30-basis point decrease in trend output growth (see the May 2008 issue of the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin)', '[2] After the transition to the euro, the yield curve was fully in line with the benchmark set by the most credible currencies before EMU', 'As a result, in some euro area countries, medium and long-term market interest rates fell to unprecedented levels when the euro was introduced and have remained there since', 'This is a phenomenal benefit', 'In fact, most euro area countries have benefited from significantly better financing conditions than in the 1990s, a situation that has supported fiscal consolidation', 'For instance, in the run-up to Stage Three of EMU, fiscal deficits were reduced considerably, mainly on account of falling interest payments, from an average of 5', '2% of GDP between 1990 and 1998 to 3', '4% between 1999 and 2007 (see ECB, “10th Anniversary of the ECB”, Special Edition of the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin, June 2008)', '[3] Not so long ago, the impact of movements of the Deutsche Mark against the US dollar was often aggravated by similar movements between the currencies that have now been replaced by the euro', 'This can no longer happen', 'This increasing resilience is illustrated by the fact that the major shocks of the last ten years have not played an important role in the dispersion of output growth', 'In other words, they have not contributed to the economic diversity that I will now go on to discuss', '[4] In 2007, for instance, the female employment rate was 58% in the euro area, compared with 66% in the United States in 2006; among older workers, it was 43', '3%, compared with 61', '7% in the United States in 2006, while the youth employment rate was 38%, compared with 54', '2% in the United States in 2006', 'In the case of the euro area, these features appear to be consistent with an “insider-outsider” characterisation of the European labour market, where structural impediments resulting from the legal and regulatory environment, high taxes on labour and rigidities associated with wage regulations may prevent those groups “at the margin” from actively participating in the labour market', '[5] Euro area data on hours worked per worker in 2007 are assumed to be constant', 'US data on hours worked per worker are estimated using OECD data for 2006 and 2007', 'The source of the data is the AMECO database', '[6] According to the European Commission, total factor productivity grew, on average, by 1', '6% in the 1980s, before falling to 1', '1% in the 1990s and to 0', '7% between 1999 and 2007', 'The countries that have managed to exploit the efficiency gains resulting, in particular, from new technology have enjoyed stronger labour productivity growth', 'For instance, in the last ten years, investment in information and communication technology in the United States was double that of the euro area', 'According to the EUKLEMS database, the average contribution from ICT capital to total economic growth in the euro area was 0', '4\\xa0percentage point over the period 1995-2005, while in the United States it averaged 0', '8 percentage point over this same period', '[7] It appears that the structural characteristics of the best-performing industrialised economies, namely more flexible labour markets, greater competition in product markets and lower barriers to entry for new firms have been more receptive to the opportunities provided by new technologies', '[8] Diversity is sometimes referred to as heterogeneity or divergences: in my view, diversity might be more appropriate in most cases because a significant degree of dispersion looks like not a defect but a fundamental feature of any vast continental economy like the US or the euro area', '[9] An example of this is the Netherlands, which undertook labour market reforms far earlier than the largest euro area countries', 'This enhanced the country’s flexibility and increased its ability to adjust to a wide range of shocks', 'In other countries, short-term shocks may have had more persistent effects on growth differentials owing to slow adjustment processes caused by the presence of structural rigidities', '[10] The behaviour of the public sector can, for instance, make social partners more aware of the trade-off between higher salaries and job creation', 'Furthermore, population ageing in most industrialised economies – and a significant increase in the old-age dependency ratio and higher healthcare and long-term care expenditures will exert growing pressure on public finances', '[11] The need for structural reforms was highlighted by the Lisbon agenda of 2000, which represents a fundamental and ambitious programme to draw Europe’s attention to the major areas where changes are required', 'More recently, the Lisbon agenda has been refocused in the direction of growth and employment', 'Various attainable objectives have been set in order to enhance the flexibility and adaptability of labour markets, to raise competition in markets for goods and services, to increase employment, to promote innovation and to strengthen growth and employment rates in all participating countries', '[12] These topics are clearly reflected in the Integrated Guidelines for the new phase of the Lisbon Strategy and the recommendations for the euro area', 'We appreciate the renewed impetus toward reforms by some governments, which has now resulted in the more focused “Partnership for Growth and Jobs” and in the structural reform commitments of the national reform programmes', 'We also need to reinforce the benchmarking of good performance in order to identify with greater accuracy the areas where reform challenges are most urgent', '[13] In this context, the Governing Council considers that features that enforce wage rigidity and lead to non-optimal wage-setting, in particular, and the indexation of nominal wages to the consumer price index, should be avoided', 'This is especially relevant today, with the risk of second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on wages', 'Avoiding these practices is essential to preserve price stability in the medium term and, in turn, the purchasing power of all euro area citizens', '[14] See the introductory article of the special issue on the slowdown in productivity growth in The Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol', '2, No\\xa04, 1988,', '[15] The European Commission recently estimated that the Single Market had created 2', '75 million jobs and had brought about an increase in welfare of €518 per head in 2006, corresponding to a 2', '15% increase in EU GDP over the period 1992-2006 (see European Commission, “The single market: review of achievements”, November 2007)', '[16] Understandably, for the ECB, further European financial integration is essential given its relevance to the conduct of the single monetary policy', 'Considerable progress has already been made across various market segments', 'Financial integration is generally more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy', 'While the euro area banking markets for wholesale and capital market-related activities have shown clear signs of increasing integration since the introduction of the euro, the retail banking segment has remained more fragmented, leaving European firms and consumers unable to take full advantage of EMU and the Single Market', '[17] While many Member States expect to increase their spending in this area, the EU will fall short of its overall target of 3% of GDP by 2010', 'Increasing investment in research and development is not, of course, an objective in itself', 'If we want to see an impact on growth, it is also the return on that R&D that matters'])\n",

last year and how the ECB responded', 'I will then look at the prospects for this year, before discussing some of the policy challenges we face in ensuring a strong recovery from the pandemic and how to manage the transition to a greener and more digital economy', 'The year behind us: responding forcefully to an unprecedented crisis  2020 will be remembered for the pandemic, which led to an unprecedented economic contraction', 'The European institutions and the EU Member States reacted swiftly, creatively and resolutely, and the ECB played a vital role', 'Our monetary policy response was centred around two key pillars', 'First, in March 2020 we launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with an initial envelope of €750 billion', 'But over the course of the year, incoming data pointed to a more pronounced impact of the pandemic on the euro area economy and a more protracted weakness in inflation than previously envisaged', 'So the ECB’s Governing Council expanded the PEPP envelope twice, first by €600 billion in June, and then by a further €500 billion in December, for a new total of €1,850 billion', 'The PEPP was tailored to the specific nature of the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis and serves a dual purpose', 'First, it can be operated as a powerful market backstop to prevent destabilising financial dynamics and breakdowns in monetary transmission', 'And second, it can act as an instrument that supports our monetary policy stance by smoothing out the impact of the pandemic on our price stability objective', 'These two engines have been activated with varying intensity over the two phases of the pandemic emergency', 'The backstop engine was the first to be ignited, amidst the financial panic in the early stages of the pandemic', 'It helped preserve the transmission of our monetary policy to all sectors and countries in the euro area, thereby averting an even deeper economic contraction', 'The second engine took over when markets eventually calmed and has been instrumental in nudging inflation closer to the path that we were projecting before the pandemic hit', 'Our targeted longer-term refinancing operations – or TLTROs – were the second major pillar of our crisis management strategy', 'We have eased and adapted the terms and conditions of our TLTRO III programme to reinforce its inbuilt incentive for banks to lend to firms and households', 'This makes the TLTROs a powerful complement to the PEPP, as they concentrate on the downstream phases of monetary policy transmission – those that work through banks and more directly reach small and medium-sized enterprises, which are most reliant on bank financing', 'The year ahead: dealing with uncertainty and paving the way for a sustainable recovery  Let me now turn to the outlook for our economy', 'The start of vaccination campaigns across the euro area provides the eagerly awaited light at the end of the tunnel', 'At the same time, the renewed surge in COVID-19 cases, the mutations in the virus and the strict containment measures are a significant downside risk to euro area economic activity', 'Output remains well below pre-pandemic levels and uncertainty about how the pandemic will evolve remains high', 'However, when containment measures are lifted and uncertainty recedes, we expect the recovery to be supported by favourable financing conditions, expansionary fiscal policies and a recovery in demand', '[2]  Despite the steep increase in January due to a confluence of factors, inflation remains low', 'This can be attributed to weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets', 'While we expect headline inflation to increase further over the coming months, underlying price pressures are likely to remain subdued owing to weak demand, low wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate', '[3]  In this environment, an accommodative monetary policy stance remains essential', 'It ensures that financing conditions remain favourable to put the economic recovery on a self-sustaining trajectory', 'Our pledge to preserve favourable financing conditions is crucial in the current environment as it reduces uncertainty about the terms at which the economy can access external finance', 'This bolsters confidence and will encourage consumer spending and business investment', 'A more solid recovery is a precondition for re-anchoring inflation around its pre-pandemic path', 'At the same time, and as I have stressed many times in this Parliament, it remains crucial that monetary and fiscal policy continue to work hand in hand', 'Fiscal policy – both at the national and at the European level – remains crucial to bolster the recovery in the euro area and address the impact of the pandemic', 'It can channel economic support to where it is most needed', 'By protecting workers and households and providing lifelines to viable firms that have been hit hard by the pandemic, fiscal support is particularly powerful in boosting aggregate demand', 'However, we need to remain vigilant – while fiscal support is crucial at this stage, it should be targeted and focused on the measures that are most conducive to economic growth', 'Against this backdrop, the ground-breaking Next Generation EU package should be implemented in such a way that the EU and all its Member States emerge from this crisis with stronger economic structures and a high degree of cohesion', 'If implemented as planned, Next Generation EU could even boost growth as early as this year', 'Resetting the course of our economies by investing in the future It is essential that the Next Generation EU funds are disbursed quickly and used to support structural reforms and growth-enhancing investment projects', 'This would boost potential growth and contribute to reaching the EU’s objectives in the areas of climate change and digitalisation', 'We also need ambitious EU policies to make sure that bond and equity markets complement bank lending and public resources in financing a sustainable recovery', 'Progress in the area of sustainable finance, for instance, is pivotal to accelerate the transition towards a low-carbon economy', 'Efforts to deepen the Single Market, notably its digital dimension and in the services sector, would provide additional support to the recovery', 'As co-legislator, the

relative reliance on wholesale funding – which proved particularly run-prone in the early stages of the financial crisis – in favour of a greater share of deposits in their liabilities', 'But building resilience has been a long and hard-earned process, bolstered by public support – in the form of capital support and guarantees – at its peak amounting to as much as one and a half trillion euro in gross terms', 'And though the sector is now stronger and more stable, it is also facing major challenges in terms of earnings capacity and profitability', 'The return on equity of significant euro area banking groups still remains well below their cost of capital', 'Market valuations point to an expectation of subdued earnings prospects going forward', 'And further signs of weakness have emerged in response to the different episodes of financial market turbulence since the start of 2016, which saw euro area banks’ price-to-book ratios particularly hard-hit', 'This troubling picture can be explained by four interlinked challenges', 'The first is the legacy challenge bequeathed by the euro area’s twin crisis, in which the financial crisis morphed into a sovereign debt crisis and a double-dip recession', 'This has left a legacy of persistently high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) in parts of the euro area, which drive down bank profitability through loan-loss provisioning charges', 'NPLs also hamper the contribution of the banking system to the recovery in parts of the euro area economy, which in turn leads to weaker macroeconomic outcomes and still slower balance sheet repair', 'Question marks over how and when these NPLs will be resolved do little to improve the situation', 'Second is the cyclical challenge posed by the low growth and low inflation environment, which goes along with lower levels of policy interest rates', 'So far, low rates have not had a marked effect on bank profitability, with net income actually increasing between 2014 and 2015', 'But with interest rates expected to remain “low for long” in the euro area, market analysts expect a significant reduction in (already low) returns on equity over the next five years, especially for banks whose business models are strongly reliant on maturity transformation', 'The relatively subdued growth outlook is also expected to weigh on credit demand and hence income growth from loan volumes', 'Structural challenges are a third factor in weak profitability', 'Though the efficiency of the euro area banking sector has improved since the crisis, with median cost-to-income ratios declining by almost 10 percentage points, operating costs remain high in some national banking systems, especially those which are characterised by overcapacity', 'Banks with high fixed costs are also facing increasing competitive pressures from non-banks and new FinTech entrants', 'While there has been some industry consolidation in response, it has largely taken place within countries, meaning higher efficiency has come at the cost of increased national concentration', 'Further rationalisation of branches and consolidation of entities appears necessary', 'But in a truly integrated euro area banking sector, what I would ideally like to see – as a medium-term goal – is such consolidation to go hand-in-hand with greater geographical diversification', 'Which is to say: banks achieving economies of scope and scale from cross-border mergers and acquisitions, while also deepening macroeconomic risk-sharing by diversifying country risks', 'This is, in my view, the litmus test of whether we have completed a genuine banking union', 'Fourth are regulatory challenges', 'The increased resilience of the euro area banking sector is in large part down to the regulatory agenda since the crisis, but it is hard to deny that this agenda has also created some uncertainties, for instance over steady state capital levels, which are reflected in bank share prices', 'Regulatory constraints have had a direct impact on earnings capacity too, especially in the investment banking space', 'Revenue generation from fee, commission and trading income has fallen significantly as a percentage of assets since the crisis', 'This is a welcome and intended consequence of restrictions on excessive risk-taking, but comes at a time when interest income is also being compressed', 'The slump in bank profitability is not, per se, a concern for policymakers', 'The banking sector needs to adjust to a changing market environment just like any other economic sector', 'But – as I will explain in today’s speech – the struggles of banks are not innocuous from a monetary policy perspective given their integral role for monetary policy transmission and macroeconomic performance more generally', 'And the newfound financial resilience of the euro area banking system can only be sustained if it is accompanied by improved financial performance in the future', 'So the situation needs close attention and the risks must be carefully monitored', 'But in my view, the path towards a more healthy and sustainable sector involves a clear division of responsibilities', 'Monetary policy will continue its accommodative stance until inflation returns to our aim, which will remove some of the cyclical drivers of weak profitability linked to disappointing nominal growth', 'This will require interest rates to remain low for an extended period of time', 'As such, it is urgent that, in parallel, steps be taken to address the other challenges depressing profitability: tackling legacy NPLs, responding to structural change, providing regulatory clarity', 'Such a comprehensive approach means both private actors and other policymakers must play their part', 'Let me address these points in greater detail', 'Monetary policy effectiveness and the state of the domestic banking system In a predominantly bank-intermediated financial system like the euro area’s, monetary policy-makers have an inherent interest in the position and prospects of the domestic banking system', 'This interest has three dimensions: the efficiency of monetary policy transmission; economic shock-absorption; and longer-term macroeconomic performance', 'Efficiency of transmission relates to the capacity of banks to pass on monetary impulses to the real economy, which is an essential pre-requisite for central banks to influence cyclical conditions and ensure price stability over a medium-term horizon', 'Bank-enabled economic shock-absorption relates to the capacity of banks to accommodate temporary financing needs of firms, households, and the public sector, thereby helping them follow smoother spending and investment profiles and, in turn, mitigating the macroeconomic fluctuations that follow from a given shock', 'Finally, the contribution of banks to longer-term macroeconomic performance stems from their capacity to allocate capital to the economic sectors deploying it most productively and to facilitate savings and investment decisions by bridging the gap between current and future spending decisions', 'In other words: a healthy banking system makes it easier for central banks to respond to a given shock; it reduces the overall impact that this shock would exert on the economy, even absent a monetary response; and it improves the steady state to which the economy gravitates when the shock has dissipated', 'These critical interactions between monetary policy and the banking system were already well-understood prior to the crisis', 'But, during the crisis, their relevance became palpable as the banking system failed as a conduit of monetary policy impulses, transformed from a shock-absorber into a shock-propagator, and – bogged down by necessary but painful balance sheet repair efforts – has not made a decisive contribution to the recovery', 'This crucial role of the banking system explains why many of our monetary policy interventions during the crisis were aimed at repairing the bank lending channel', 'Those interventions can be divided into three phases', 'Bank-based monetary policy transmission during the crisis The first phase, which started in the summer of 2007 and escalated after the collapse of Lehman Brothers a year later, consisted in a systemic liquidity run at global level triggered by lack of transparency on the amount and distribution of risks related to certain types of privately issued securities', 'The resultant seizing-up of the interbank market spilt-over to the entire financial system and forced banks and other institutions into a fire-sale of assets so as to stay current on their short-term liabilities', 'The ECB confronted this situation by elastically accommodating the liquidity needs of the banking sector and by lengthening the duration of its refinancing operations', 'Thus, we avoided that the liquidity shock morphed into a self-fulfilling solvency crisis, which would have induced a severe monetary contraction when recessionary forces instead called for forceful monetary expansion', 'The second phase of the crisis, which occurred in 2011-2012, had a specific euro area connotation, but followed a similar script as the first – only that the shift in market perceptions, this time, did not pertain to privately issued paper but to the debt instruments of certain euro area governments', 'The risks originating from this situation and the corresponding challenges to monetary policy transmission were no less severe than those from the first phase of the crisis', 'In fact, the consequence for the broader economy was, again, an acute failure of monetary policy transmission, with countries most in need of further monetary policy accommodation instead facing deteriorating financing conditions', 'And, again, the ECB responded: we adopted OMT, a commitment to stamp out unwarranted break-up risk premia from the price of the securities issued by stressed jurisdictions conditional on economic adjustment', 'But the confidence crisis had already left a harmful heritage in transmission, which heralded a third phase of crisis: banks in a vast portion of the euro area had lost their willingness and capacity to keep credit flowing to the real economy', 'Borrowing conditions were being tightened precisely at the time when the economy was entering a new slump', 'This required further flexibility in our policy framework, articulated in three main instruments: a series of targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), a negative interest rate policy, and an asset purchase programme including private and public securities', 'The TLTROs offer banks long-term refinancing conditional on their using the funds to expand lending', 'The asset purchase program, together with a negative rate applied on excess reserves, quickens the pace at which banks and other lenders are returning to economic risk-taking', \"Lower term spreads on public securities encourage a shift in the composition of banks' portfolios toward other types of exposures with a higher risk-adjusted return\", 'Finally, the tax on electronic reserves discourages liquidity hoarding and speeds up the process of asset reallocation', 'As a result of this series of measures, we are now seeing the bank-based transmission process working more smoothly', 'Banks have responded to the combination of measures by slashing their lending rates and shifting out their loan supply schedule', 'Lending volumes are picking up gradually', 'And lending rates are easing considerably: between June 2014 and July 2016, the composite cost-of-borrowing indicator for new corporate loans fell by 95 basis points in the euro area and up to 150 basis points in stressed countries', 'The role played by monetary policy in supporting bank-based transmission has been confirmed by recent academic research', '[2] In particular, studies suggest that the elastic provision of liquidity by the ECB earlier in the crisis – e', 'g', 'via the longer-term refinancing operations that started in December 2011 – was instrumental in counteracting the freezing of bank funding markets and in curtailing the risk of a credit crunch', 'The evidence also suggests that the shift in our policy strategy towards a more active support of bank lending has been successful', 'The combination of targeted longer-term refinancing operations and large-scale asset purchases has been found to have induced an increase in bank lending throughout the euro area, as well as a simultaneous reduction in the exposure of banks in stressed countries to their domestic sovereigns', 'This latter effect was not observable for the earlier, non-targeted longer-term refinancing operations that mainly served to provide banks with funding reassurance in distressed market conditions', 'At the same time, research indicates that the beneficial effects of the APP on lending volumes have been accompanied by downward pressure on lending rates, which has further reinforced the pass-through to the real economy', 'Accordingly, there are increasing signs that our monetary policy has contributed decisively to the ongoing cyclical recovery', 'And there is no doubt that a robust cyclical recovery benefits all sectors of the economy', 'But a question that has arisen in some quarters is whether, at some point, the extraordinary steps we have taken to sustain bank-based transmission may have negative side effects', 'Certainly, in the initial phases of the crisis, the side effects were positive from the perspective of banks, as they were partly shielded from the consequences of often misguided and imprudent business models they had adopted prior to the crisis', 'In recent times, however, several observers have instead emphasised another type of side effect of our measures, namely its negative impact on bank profitability', 'In fact, several market participants have laid much of the blame for the prevailing bank profitability concerns on monetary policy, in particular stressing the negative effects of low interest rates on net interest margins', 'But this perspective is partial', 'The interaction of monetary policy and bank profitability Net interest margins have indeed declined in recent years in the wake of low policy interest rates', 'But monetary policy also affects bank profitability through various other channels', 'Lower interest income has been partly offset by our measures leading to reductions in bank funding costs, higher asset valuations, and a more robust recovery– which in turn creates further demand for bank credit and improves the capacity of borrowers to service their debts', 'Accounting for these factors, we do not see strong evidence that bank profitability, on aggregate, has been suffering from our measures at this stage', 'However, the longer the current low-interest rate environment persists, the greater the challenges for bank profitability will be', 'This is because many of the benefits of monetary accommodation for bank balance sheets, such as the concomitant capital gains, are unlikely to occur on a continuous basis, whereas the drawbacks are likely to remain in place – for instance due to the downward stickiness of interest rates on retail deposits, which implies a squeeze in net interest margins if lending rates and yields were to remain at their current low levels for long', 'And the underperformance of bank equities may actually be testament to such concerns', 'Of course, weak bank equity markets are not, in the first instance, a public policy concern', 'But they may become such concern if they persist and morph into a systemic phenomenon', 'The reason is that the newfound financial resilience of the euro area banking system can only be sustained if it is accompanied by improved financial performance in the future', 'Otherwise, banks will struggle to generate capital organically or raise equity in capital markets, which is the cushion that allows banks to weather adverse shocks, retain or even increase their exposure to the real economy, respond to potential regulatory changes, and attract future investors', 'And, besides the dampening effects on their own financial resilience, this scenario would put a dent into the contribution that banks can make to the economic recovery: deteriorating earnings prospects weigh on bank equities, which in turn increases the cost banks face when raising equity in the market', 'While this increase in the cost of equity may initially be compensated by the substitution of equity with debt funding, the scope for such substitution is limited by regulatory requirements and banks’ own motives to establish adequate capital buffers', 'Hence, a persistent decline in equity valuations will ultimately render credit more costly and less profitable for banks which, in response, may curtail lending to the real economy', 'This adverse link from low interest rates to weak bank profitability to lower loan supply is particularly problematic in view of evidence suggesting that the low interest rate environment is likely to persist for an extended period of time', 'According to this evidence, declining potential growth together with a relative scarcity of safe assets to absorb global savings have led to a declining natural interest rate – that is: the rate consistent with full resource utilisation and steady inflation rates around the central bank objective over a longer-term perspective', 'In the context of such decline of the natural rate and the continued cyclical weakness, the necessary degree of monetary policy accommodation implies a constellation of very low interest rates for an extended period of time', 'Therefore, the ECB will preserve its accommodative stance until inflation returns to our aim, which will remove some of the cyclical drivers of weak profitability linked to disappointing nominal growth', 'It will be crucial to continue monitoring the implications of our monetary policy measures on the position and prospects of the banking system and approach any future re-calibration of our monetary policy toolkit, should this be necessary at all, in a way that optimises the stimulus for the broader economy without undermining the incentives for financial intermediaries to remain actively engaged in transmission', 'At the same time, additional adjustment needs should be addressed decisively to ensure a healthy euro area banking sector: tackling legacy NPLs, responding to structural change, providing regulatory clarity', 'These relate both to individual banks and to the institutional environment', 'Adjustment needs for individual banks A number of banks are now tackling their legacy and structural challenges rather than waiting for better times', 'But many still need to adjust faster to the new conditions they face', 'The process of disposing of NPLs is moving too slowly in some jurisdictions', 'And cost efficiency has to adapt to the new macroeconomic and regulatory environment', 'As noted, euro area banks have made important progress in reducing costs since the start of the crisis', 'But there is clearly scope for further improvements: cost-to-income ratios, for example, have remained high for euro area banks compared to their global peers, and progress in efficiency improvements has levelled off', 'Opportunities for efficiency gains are there', 'The technological challenge posed by FinTech, for example, is also an opening for established market participants to push out the efficient frontier, thereby protecting market shares and raising new sources of revenue in the customer-to-bank relationship, and/or increasing efficiency and cutting costs on infrastructure', 'There is also scope for both further rationalisation within banks, especially those burdened with expensive branch structures, and further consolidation among credit institutions, in particular in countries where fragmentation leads to unsound competitive behaviour and low operational efficiency', 'Indeed, even though the number of branches in the euro area declined by 16% between 2008 and 2014, almost half of the decrease in the number of local bank units was accounted for by Spain', 'Countries undergoing structural adjustment programmes have also seen the largest relative decrease in the number of credit institutions', 'Banking systems in some larger countries have also adjusted but remain at relatively low concentration levels, implying scope for rationalisation and consolidation without reinforcing the “too-big-to-fail” problem', 'To navigate the new environment, banks’ business models will need to adjust as well', 'As a consequence of both market pressures and regulation, many banks have shifted from revenue generation based on investment banking, high leverage and/or reliance on relatively cheap wholesale funding, towards business models built around retail banking, lower leverage and increased reliance on deposit funding', 'These are welcome developments from the perspective of financial stability – but they may also increase vulnerability to a very low interest rate environment', 'This calls for stronger efforts to increase income diversification, which is currently widespread only across larger banks', 'Funding costs, especially in terms of deposits, also remain high in comparison with global peers, squeezing net interest income', 'But admittedly, neither more stringent pricing policies nor greater focus on fee-generating activities will likely compensate for the downward pressure on profitability from other factors', 'And after many years of encouraging banks towards more “plain vanilla” business models, it may be unfair to now expect them to reverse course', 'That is why, if the banking sector is to adjust effectively, public authorities also need to play their part – indeed, it is their responsibility to create a sound and supportive environment for such adjustment to take place', 'To my mind there are three priority areas for action', 'Reforms at the institutional level The first is to stabilise the regulatory environment', 'As underlined in the communiqués of the recent G20 meetings, to remove one source of uncertainty, the post-crisis regulatory framework needs to be finalised in a timely, full and consistent manner – most pressingly through the completion of the Basel III framework by end-2016, without further significantly increasing overall capital requirements across the banking sector', 'Those forums have also pointed to the need for enhanced monitoring of the implementation of reforms and their effects, which is important to ensure consistency with macroeconomic policy objectives and to address any material unintended consequences', 'The second is to improve further the institutional environment for NPL resolution', 'This hinges on both supervisory pressure towards individual banks, using qualitative and quantitative measures, and on system-wide reforms to reduce the cost for banks and investors of getting NPLs off bank balance sheets', 'Most important in this context are measures to speed up asset recovery, such as improving the efficiency of judicial and insolvency procedures, and appropriate tax incentives', 'The third priority is to complete banking union', 'If we are to reap the economies of scale of a genuine single banking market, we need a euro area institutional framework that allows banks to thrive as euro area banks', 'So the main responsibility for policymakers is not to stop halfway', 'Indeed, in crucial ways, banking union remains incomplete', 'A case in point is the fact that the euro area is not treated as a single jurisdiction for the purposes of bank regulation', 'There is still non-negligible national discretion in implementing rules', 'Regulatory uncertainty remains on how fungible excess liquidity and capital is across borders', 'And the lack of single-jurisdiction status may impose – albeit limited – additional capital charges on euro area banks', 'Symptomatic is the treatment of additional capital charges for systemically important banks related to cross-border euro area exposures, which are still considered as international exposures from a regulatory perspective', 'This is just one example for a bigger point: if we are to achieve a fully integrated euro area banking sector and to reverse the retrenchment behind national borders that took place during the crisis, we need to remove any remnants of the regulatory framework that implicitly support home bias, raise the impediments to cross-border business and disadvantage euro area banks internationally', 'Though some banks have had cautionary experiences with cross-border expansions in the past, the development of pan-European banks, alongside strong local banks serving local markets, must be part of the financial landscape of monetary union', 'In a monetary union the banking landscape cannot be made up of a collection of standalone national banking systems', 'And in an environment where bank profitability is weak, and where macroeconomic stabilisation policies are already at full throttle, the benefits of such cross-border integration – efficiency and risk-sharing – are even more in demand', 'Thus a true banking union needs to be completed in a reasonable period of time', 'And that includes, as the ECB has noted on many occasions, establishing a European Deposit Insurance Scheme that can ensure the fungibility of insured bank money across all parts of the monetary union', 'Conclusion Let me conclude', 'A resilient banking system is crucial to provide for a smooth transmission of monetary policy in response to cyclical fluctuations and to support economic performance over a longer-term horizon', 'And, indeed, since the onset of crisis, euro area banks have made important progress in strengthening their financial resilience', 'At the same time, this newfound resilience will come under pressure if the current slump in bank profitability were to persist going forward', 'The prevailing low interest rate environment is one factor that dampens profitability prospects', 'But, since the ongoing recovery remains strongly reliant on continued monetary accommodation in the context of a declining natural rate, the constellation of very low interest rates will probably prevail for an extended period of time', 'Against this background, the ECB will continue monitoring the implications of our monetary policy measures on the position and prospects of the banking system', 'The analytical underpinnings of the ECB’s strategy, which have granted a prominent role to the bank-based transmission mechanism in the context of our monetary pillar, are well-suited for this task', 'At the same time, many other factors, relating to legacy and structural problems, are holding down bank profitability', 'Hence a durable improvement in the prospects of the euro area banking system requires further efforts outside the realm of monetary policy', 'These include, notably, the swift and thorough completion of banking union', 'Additional adjustment in the banking sector towards greater cost efficiency and business models that remain viable in the new regulatory and macroeconomic environment is also needed', 'For some parts of the banking system, these adjustment needs have arisen because of regulation discouraging unsustainable pre-crisis business models that were highly reliant on aggressive leverage and maturity transformation, regulatory arbitrage (in particular via off-balance sheet activities), and a lack of transparency and due diligence in the origination of financial products', 'In others, the adjustment needs reflect structural challenges and over-capacity', 'In both cases revenue sources will have to be augmented by more sustainable business models that are consistent with the new policy environment', 'Beyond the banking sector, policy needs to pave the way for a more dynamic recovery and – even more importantly – a more favourable end-point of that recovery', 'For the crisis has not just led to an underutilisation of economic capacity, but has also reduced the pace at which economic capacity itself expands – its potential growth', 'Pre-crisis, the potential growth rate in the euro area, on average, amounted to almost 2% per annum; after the crisis, this growth rate roughly halved', 'The implications for economic prosperity are striking: an economy growing at 2% more than doubles over a 40-year period; an economy growing at 1% expands by less than half over the same horizon', 'Meanwhile a strong economic basis is essential to cope with other challenges facing the euro area over the longer-term', 'These include the burden of high legacy debt, large implicit liabilities related to unfunded pension claims, and intensifying distributional concerns in the context of a widening income gap', 'We are therefore facing a mixed outlook', 'The cyclical recovery is proceeding at a moderate pace and, despite continued downside risks, has proven resilient to a range of adverse external shocks', 'The ECB’s accommodative monetary policy has been instrumental in sustaining the recovery and the gradual absorption of economic slack', 'To secure a return of inflation rates to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, it will remain necessary to preserve a very substantial amount of monetary support', 'Yet, at the same time, there are many open questions as to how to strengthen the structural recovery – that is, how to raise the growth path on which the economy will settle once it returns to full capacity', 'Here, monetary policy has limited influence and actions have to come from other policy areas', 'Thus far the actions taken have not been commensurate with the challenges the euro area is facing', 'For instance, economic policy has done too little to support the recovery in investment', 'In fact, the ratio of public investment to GDP has followed a consistent downward trend in recent years; so, instead of counteracting the crisis-related downturn in private investment, it has added to it', 'Hence a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policy remains crucial, coupled with structural reforms to improve the business climate and re-energise the private investment recovery', '[1]I would like to thank Fédéric Holm-Hadulla for his contributions to this speech and Nadya Jahn for valuable inputs', 'This text, in large parts, draws

      " list([\"Trajectories towards the euro and the role of ERM II   Speech by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the 2002 East-West Conference 'Structural challenges and the search for an adequate policy mix in the EU and in central and eastern Europe', Vienna, 4 November 2002\", 'Introduction       Thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in this conference', 'In my remarks today, I would like to share with you some thoughts on the policy challenges faced by accession countries in the run-up to the adoption of the euro', 'As you may know, most accession countries have expressed their intention to adopt the euro as soon as possible after joining the EU', 'To this end, they have embarked on policies aimed at achieving both nominal and real convergence with the euro area', 'This is not a trivial task', \"It involves i) advancing disinflation – or preserving the price stability achieved thus far – ii) completing the process of transition and iii) enhancing the economies' medium-term growth potential\", 'In this context, the concepts of real and nominal convergence become crucial', 'Thus I will focus my remarks on them', 'After defining the concepts, I will argue for the need to enhance the processes of real and nominal convergence with the euro area and provide a rationale for the simultaneous, or parallel, pursuit of both', 'I shall conclude by highlighting that ERM II ought to be regarded as a powerful framework for combining nominal and real convergence, and not as a mere \"waiting-room\" prior to adoption of the euro', 'Developments in nominal and real convergence       Let me start by briefly recalling the progress in nominal and real convergence that accession countries have made thus far', 'A significant degree of nominal convergence has been achieved', 'Looking at the accession countries as a whole (Accessionland, for short) we see that inflation has been reduced from nearly 70% in 1992 to about 4', '5% in mid-2002', 'In addition, both short-term and long-term interest rates have fallen substantially in most countries, reflecting lower inflation expectations as well as the nearing prospect of EU accession', 'However, notable cross-country differences remain', 'While some countries have achieved solid results and now face the challenge of advancing disinflation from moderate to low rates, others are in a more fragile position, uncertain whether gains are sustainable or whether they are only short-lived', 'Turning to real income convergence, progress appears much more limited in most countries when looking at the most commonly used indicator, i', 'e', 'per capita income levels', 'Indeed, in Accessionland per capita income stands at about 20% of the EU average in current exchange rates and at about 40% of the EU average in purchasing power standards', 'Thus, we can no doubt expect the current enlargement to increase the diversity of income levels of the EU in an unprecedented manner', 'But would that be so important', 'Are there not already significant differences in income levels across – and even within – euro area member countries', 'Indeed there are', 'For example, the per capita income level of the city of Brussels is twice the EU average and that of Lombardia is twice that of Sicily or Campania', 'In my view, the most relevant concept of real convergence for successful participation in Monetary Union is not per capita income levels, but rather assessing whether economic structures are in line with those of the euro area and whether new entrants have set up appropriate institutions and adopted international best practices and standards', 'Thus, real convergence encompasses not only real income convergence but also, and more importantly, real structural convergence', 'If we look at real convergence in such terms, we see that, encouragingly, Accessionland has made remarkable progress', 'Indeed, a range of institutional, legislative and infrastructure reforms has been implemented, so as to increase economic integration and allow structural alignment with the euro area', 'If assessed by per capita income alone, progress in real convergence is likely to be underestimated', 'The risk of underestimating real convergence does not refer to current outcomes alone, but also to future prospects', 'This is because of the positive correlation between progress in structural reforms and subsequent income convergence', 'Structural convergence and institutional reform can and should be looked at as an investment, one contributing to a more favourable business environment and a more efficient allocation of financial flows', 'Thus, we can ask: whether structural convergence lays the foundations for further income convergence, and what pace of growth and catching-up can we expect in the new members of the EU', 'Let us briefly explore this issue', 'Further real income convergence: the optimal trajectory       The seminal models for economic growth assumed that growth and real convergence in low-income countries were exogenously driven processes, led by given technology improvements and relatively higher factor returns', 'However, the recent literature has found that economic growth is rather an endogenously determined process, led by a wide set of variables, including policy variables', 'Important determinants in the growth process are, along with the initial level of income and real investment, human capital, trade openness, FDI flows and a set of institutional variables, such as democracy and political stability, financial development, rule of law, etc', 'Now, it is very encouraging that the overall experience of Accessionland is in line with these findings', 'Indeed, GDP growth has picked up in recent years largely thanks to broad macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reforms', 'In particular, 2000 and 2001 were the first years since the beginning of the transition in which virtually all accession countries registered positive growth', 'And it is noteworthy that, in spite of the world economic slowdown, growth differentials with the euro area are holding up well, at around 1', '5 percentage points', 'Looking ahead, the medium-term prospects for economic growth in accession countries are also quite positive', 'A relatively skilled labour force, large FDI inflows, a high degree of trade openness, macroeconomic stabilisation and progress in institutional reforms are all factors that should contribute to income convergence over the medium term', \"It should also be noted that, since the full impact of structural reforms on economic growth is likely to come with a few years' lag, a further strengthening of output growth in accession countries can be expected in the medium term\", 'In addition, several studies have argued that the relatively poor countries tend to profit more and for a longer period of time from EU membership than richer ones', '[1] Taken together, a pick-up in economic growth in accession countries during the coming years to a range of 4-6% does not seem implausible', 'Of course, such encouraging possibilities will become reality to the extent that economic policies are sound', 'From a policy perspective, the following general point can be made', 'A convergence trajectory of real per capita income towards EU level could be regarded as both \"natural\" and optimal as long as the higher growth rates are based on developments in fundamental factors, rather than \"artificially\" boosted by short-sighted measures', 'Efforts to enhance economic growth over and above these \"natural\" rates by, for example, expansionary monetary and fiscal policies would not be sustainable and should be avoided', 'Indeed, such policies are likely to be counterproductive, as they may endanger macroeconomic stability and, thereby, economic growth', 'Further nominal convergence and its interaction with real convergence       Having addressed the factors for an optimal trajectory of real income convergence, let me now turn to the determinants for an optimal trajectory of nominal convergence', 'The key questions here are: can the substantial disinflation gains and the low-inflation environment be maintained and entrenched', 'If so, how', 'When addressing these questions, the following aspects need to be considered', 'As I said, progress in nominal convergence has been substantial in Accessionland', 'Still, maintaining low inflation will be a challenge owing to multiple factors, some of which are unavoidable and indeed normal, and some of which are pernicious and should be avoided', 'Let me take them in turn', 'Upward pressure on the price level is bound to come from macroeconomic factors – such as the impact of higher productivity growth and the associated Balassa-Samuelson effect – as well as from further price liberalisation and deregulation', 'The gradual increase of prices towards the level of richer EU countries along with the increase in income levels should not constitute a source of major concern, as it results from a structural and desirable adjustment in the real economy, and not from over-expansionary policies', 'I would like to refer to this type of price dynamics as a benign form of inflation, a \"physiological inflation\"', 'Although it has been relatively limited in recent years, \"physiological inflation\" could become more pronounced in the future, to a large extent due to higher economic growth', 'As for price liberalisation, despite substantial progress in the last decade, administered prices still account for around one-fifth of the CPI in most accession countries', 'As prices are often fixed at levels far below cost-recovery, liberalisation (as required for EU membership) is likely to add on inflation in the coming years', 'Taken together, the Balassa-Samuelson effect and price liberalisation imply that not only income, but also prices are likely to converge to the EU levels, which effectively lead to inflation rates temporarily above the EU average', 'It is conceivable, however, that a less benign form of price dynamics can also arise in accession countries', 'Indeed, an extensive economic literature as well as experience show that extra inflation, in addition to that caused by the physiological factors just considered, may appear', 'This is the result of inappropriate macroeconomic and wage policies combined with structural weaknesses in the economy', 'Such inflation can be called a \"pathological\" component of inflation outcomes', 'How can  \"pathological inflation\"  best be avoided or reduced', 'My answer is that it can be avoided or reduced by making society (and wage negotiators above all) aware of its evil, by ensuring the continuation of high and effective central bank independence, as well as with efforts to reduce structural rigidities in the economies', 'In Accessionland, given that central bank independence has been established only recently and that the economies still suffer from structural rigidities, there is evidence that the pathological component of inflation has not been yet completely removed', 'Indeed, structural rigidities – reflected, for example, in high unemployment, or a wider GDP gap vis-à-vis the EU – appear to be related to inflation differentials across accession countries', 'This suggests that high unemployment and/or wide output gaps have made it harder for the authorities to stick to their commitment to anti-inflationary policy', 'This finding yields important policy implications', 'It indicates that disinflation and nominal convergence require a number of consistent and concomitant actions and attitudes', 'Firstly, it is crucial to ensure substantial independence for the central bank and for monetary policy', 'Secondly, there is a need for policies that enhance labour market flexibility and the general efficiency of the economies', 'Finally, continuous explanation to the public of the benefits of price stability is required', 'Such actions will help reduce the incentives to pursue expansionary policies, strengthen popular support for stability-oriented policies, and gradually remove the pathological component of current inflation outcomes', 'Progress in disinflation would also be facilitated by prudent fiscal policies', 'In the case of fixed exchange rate regimes, fiscal deficits and public debt accumulation would expand domestic credit and add to inflationary pressures', 'For countries operating flexible exchange rates, fiscal deficits can lead to external vulnerability and pressure on the exchange rate', 'In addition, the commitment to fight inflation might be undermined over time, as the real value of larger government debt can be reduced by higher inflation', 'All in all, in order to preserve disinflation gains, the need for medium-term fiscal consolidation is overwhelming', 'The above-mentioned arguments imply that further nominal and real convergence can and should be pursued in parallel over the coming years', 'The reason for this is that in accession countries many of the structural weaknesses that currently contribute to the inflation bias also dampen output and employment growth', 'Hence, as structural reforms and fiscal consolidation advance, inflation can be lowered without jeopardising a higher medium-term growth path', 'ERM II: a framework, not a waiting-room        Confronted with the challenge of pursuing real and nominal convergence simultaneously, accession countries need to pay special attention to the choice of an exchange rate strategy', 'Indeed, such a strategy has a key role because it provides a framework within which monetary policy can continue to be geared towards price stability, while real convergence may proceed without being hampered by undue exchange rate movements', 'Most accession countries have already indicated their intention to join ERM II as early as possible after entry into the EU', 'Several of them have also signalled their intention to adopt the euro as soon as possible', 'In my view, however, ERM II membership has to be considered also from a nominal and real convergence perspective', 'Specifically, it could be related to the following question: does ERM II provide a useful framework to foster the combination of real with nominal convergence in Accessionland', 'My answer is clearly positive for two reasons', 'The first reason is that, being small open economies, accession countries cannot disregard exchange rate developments and need to have a view on the appropriate level or range for the exchange rate', 'By communicating their view, they can help guide market participants in their own assessment of the appropriate level of the exchange rate at any point in time', 'I am aware, of course, that the formulation of such a view, which is always problematic, is particularly difficult in economies that are still involved in a transition and convergence process', 'Indeed, in such economies the equilibrium exchange rate is subject to shocks and gradual changes over time', 'However, ERM II provides a framework for guiding the market, while the wide bands leave sufficient margin for unavoidable market developments', 'For such a regime to be credible, two conditions are crucial', 'The first is that all policy-makers adjust their policies to make them consistent with this regime; the second is that exchange rates should be adjusted if cumulative large shocks or fundamental changes substantially modify their equilibrium level', 'If these two conditions are observed, ERM II will indeed be a framework that provides both stability and flexibility – a combination that is likely to be beneficial for many of the current accession countries in their real and nominal convergence process', 'The second reason that makes me think that ERM II is a valuable framework rather than a simple waiting-room, is the fact that it is a multilateral arrangement', 'As such, ERM II is consistent with the regional integration process in which all accession countries are so deeply involved', 'In an increasingly globalised world, with little room for independent monetary policy, a supra-national institutional framework such as ERM II is likely to have fewer potential weaknesses than other, mainly unilateral, exchange rate strategies', 'Its multilateral nature and the ultimate exit into the euro area make it much less subject to the criticism that is usually attributed to so-called intermediate regimes', 'ERM II is an \"intermediate\" exchange rate regime only in the sense that it is intermediate to the adoption of the euro', 'To sum up, participation in ERM II should not be seen as a mere waiting-room prior to the adoption of the euro, not even as a \"business lounge\", as I have once heard', 'Instead, it should be regarded as a meaningful and flexible framework for combining nominal and real convergence, and for tackling the challenges faced by the accession countries in the run-up to the adoption of the euro', 'Conclusions       Accession countries are facing the challenge of further advancing nominal and real convergence with the euro area', 'With regard to real convergence, they have largely advanced structural and institutional convergence, which should support the process of further convergence in real income', 'As for nominal convergence, a distinction between \"physiological\" inflation – induced by catching-up productivity growth and price deregulation – and \"pathological\" inflation – defined as an inflation rate in excess of the socially desired one – can and should be made', 'Bearing in mind that \"pathological\" inflation has not yet been fully removed from accession countries, nominal convergence needs to focus on removing this component of inflation', 'Strengthening central bank independence and progress in structural reform are crucial in this regard', 'All in all, my remarks suggest two main implications for policies pursued by the accession countries', 'First, it is clear that, understood in the way I described, nominal convergence will not hamper growth prospects', 'Second, further real convergence through institutional and legislative reforms and structural adjustments is crucial to advance nominal convergence', 'This is why nominal and real convergence are, let me say it again, two sides of the same coin and thus can be, and need to be, pursued in parallel', 'Supported by the EU institutional framework, a realistic credible choice of the time horizon for the adoption of the euro may be a catalyst for economic reform in accession countries and, thus, for real convergence with the euro area', 'ERM II should be seen as a meaningful framework within which to achieve further real and nominal convergence', 'In addition, ERM II may provide an appropriate framework to avoid major misalignments when choosing the conversion rates to the euro', 'Overall, further reform and appropriate policy design shall continue to support GDP growth and low inflation in accession countries, and will make the path towards adoption of the euro smooth and highly beneficial in terms of gains in economic welfare', '[1] See, for example, J', 'Crespo-Cuaresma, M', 'Dimitz and D',

notably above the ECB’s new symmetric target of 2% to be attained over the medium term', '[1]  The recent rise in inflation, which was at least partly expected, has intensified the debate about the most likely future evolution of price pressures – in the euro area and elsewhere', 'It stands in sharp contrast to the developments observed over the past decade when structural headwinds prevented inflation from converging towards our target', 'The timing of this conference on inflation drivers and dynamics could therefore hardly be more fitting', 'I will begin my remarks by briefly discussing how the current spike in inflation can in large part be attributed to temporary pandemic-related factors that are likely to dissipate in the medium term', 'Then I will turn to a more thorough discussion of the headwinds and tailwinds that may contribute to the evolution of inflation over the medium term, linking them to research that will be presented at this conference', 'My main focus will be on two important topics: inflation expectations and behavioural changes, for example regarding firms’ price setting behaviour', 'We devoted a substantial part of our recently concluded strategy review to understanding how these factors affect inflation dynamics, and continue to pursue an ambitious research agenda in these areas', '[2] Opportunities such as this conference provide a welcome platform to interact with the academic community and thereby advance our thinking on these topics', 'The papers that will be presented at this conference address many questions that are highly relevant in the current debate on inflation and therefore have important ramifications for the future conduct of monetary policy', 'Near-term prospects: an inflation sneeze Let me begin by recalling the evolution of price dynamics in the euro area over the ten years that have passed since inflation last reached levels around 3%', 'Over most of the past decade, inflation has persistently fallen short of the ECB’s previous inflation aim of below, but close to, 2 percent', 'Both headline and core inflation averaged around 1% between January 2013 and December 2019 (Chart 1)', 'Chart 1 Euro area headline and core HICP inflation  (annual percentage changes)   Source: Eurostat and ECB calculations', 'Latest observation: September 2021 (flash estimate)', 'Moreover, inflation repeatedly surprised on the downside relative to our in-house staff projections before the pandemic (Chart\\xa02)', 'Other international institutions and financial market participants also continuously overpredicted future inflation developments', 'Chart\\xa02 Eurosystem headline annual inflation projections over time  (annual percentage changes)   Source: ECB', 'Note: The chart is based on annual inflation data', 'Latest observation: August 2021, September 2021 Macroeconomic Projections', 'Subdued inflation dynamics were driven by both cyclical and structural factors, which, in combination, created sustained headwinds for underlying price pressures', 'A high level of slack after the double-dip recession, diminishing conventional monetary policy space in the vicinity of the effective lower bound as well as structural factors, such as globalisation, digitalisation and demographic change, have all contributed to persistently low inflation rates', 'During our monetary policy strategy review, we conducted detailed analysis to examine the relative importance of these drivers', '[3]  The pandemic has added a whirlwind of short-term disruptions on top of these long-term trends', 'Initially, the pandemic had put further downward pressure on inflation in the euro area', 'Inflation declined substantially in 2020, with rates temporarily entering negative territory in the second half of the year', 'Much of that decline was attributable to specific pandemic-related, temporary factors, including a substantial decline in commodity prices and the temporary cut in German VAT rates', 'With the onset of the recovery, inflation picked up rapidly', 'In fact, the current spike in inflation owes much to the continued impact of those same factors that pushed down inflation earlier in the annual comparison', 'Consequently, their impact on inflation rates will be transitory', '[4] Indeed, more than half of measured headline inflation in the euro area, based on the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP), is currently due to rising energy prices and the reversal of the German VAT cut (Chart 3)', 'Inflation has also been affected by changes in the weights in the consumption basket', 'Consumption patterns changed markedly last year owing to the impact of lockdowns, leading to a shift in consumption weights that are used to calculate Eurostat’s inflation index', 'These changing weights can have a notable impact on the measurement of inflation: HICP inflation would have been even higher in recent months using last year’s weights (Chart 3)', 'For example, assuming constant consumption weights, euro area services inflation would have amounted to 2', '1% in September instead of 1', '7% indicated by the flash estimate', 'Due to the construction method of the HICP, the pandemic-induced expenditure shifts will continue to affect the index calculation until at least 2022', '[5]   Chart 3 Contributions to annual HICP inflation in the euro area  (annual percentage changes; percentage point contributions)   Source: Eurostat, Deutsche Bundesbank, September narrow inflation projection exercise (NIPE) and ECB calculations', 'Notes: Contributions from main HICP components exclude the impact of changes in HICP weights and the VAT rate cut in Germany', 'The impact of weight changes is estimated by the ECB', 'The contribution made by the temporary VAT cut in Germany is based on estimates provided in the Deutsche Bundesbank’s November 2020 Monthly Report', 'Latest observation: September 2021 (flash estimate)', 'Two further pandemic-related factors are also having a temporary – if somewhat more durable – impact on inflation', 'First, continued supply chain disruptions, augmented by the global economic recovery, are pushing up producer prices due to supply and demand imbalances, thus feeding into non-energy industrial goods inflation, which has been exceptionally strong recently (Chart 4, left panel)', 'Second, the re-opening of the economy has pushed up services inflation to 1', '1% in August and 1', '7% in September according to the flash estimate', '[6] This recent surge in services inflation is predominantly due to rising price pressures in high-contact services (Chart 4, right panel)', 'Chart 4 Non-energy goods and services inflation  (annual percentage changes; percentage point contributions)   Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations', 'Note: Series are shown with constant 2020 weights', 'Latest observations: August 2021', 'Speaking metaphorically, the current inflationary spike can be compared to a sneeze: the economy’s reaction to dust being kicked up in the wake of the pandemic and the ensuing recovery', 'And even though these pandemic-related developments are currently dominating media headlines, chances are high that the current episode of above-target inflationary pressures will subside over time', 'In our baseline projections, we assume that the supply bottlenecks as well as the impact of the re-opening will normalise over the course of 2022', 'The latest data and survey results, including findings on potential second-round effects in wage bargaining, do not suggest that price pressures will persist', '[7] At present, headline inflation is forecast to fall back below our medium-term inflation target of 2% in the medium term (Chart 5)', 'Similarly, core inflation is projected to rise only gradually', 'Chart 5 Eurosystem inflation projections  (annual percentage changes)   Source: ECB', 'Note: The chart is based on annual inflation data', 'Latest observation: August 2021, September 2021 Macroeconomic Projections', 'Medium-term outlook: feeling the breeze However, it would be premature to assert that current price dynamics will fully subside next year', 'The persistence of inflationary pressures ultimately depends on whether the dust kicked up by the pandemic continues to settle as the economic recovery takes hold', 'There are several sources of uncertainty that might entail more persistent inflationary pressures', 'As we form our assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook, we keep our finger in the wind to determine whether the breeze will turn out to be more long-lived than just a transitory gust', 'It is also possible that the pandemic has altered or reinforced structural trends, thus affecting inflation dynamics in the years to come', 'The remarkable increase in the pace of digitalisation and the mounting efforts to fight climate change are a case in point', 'Against the background of research contributions presented at this conference, I would like to highlight two additional, and possibly related, types of uncertainty that will determine whether current inflationary trends will turn out to be more persistent', 'First, the current uptick in inflation might result in a more enduring upward revision of expectations about nominal costs and inflation', 'And second, the pandemic may have triggered behavioural changes that alter rigidities at microeconomic level, such as wage and price stickiness, thus having an impact on the slope of the Phillips curve', 'The role of inflation expectations Let me begin with inflation expectations', 'The standard prescription for monetary policy is to “look through” temporary supply-side shocks and to only take policy action if inflation expectations and wage bargaining give rise to second-round effects posing a threat to price stability', 'The difficulty with this prescription is that aggregate inflation expectations are unobservable, requiring policymakers to employ various proxy measures', 'One method is to use market-based measures of inflation compensation', 'Immediately prior to the pandemic, estimates derived from market prices pointed to medium-term inflation expectations of only 1', '1%, substantially below our medium-term inflation target (Chart 6, left panel)', 'With the onset of the pandemic and the severe disruption to economic activity, these expectations declined to nearly 0', '5% in March 2020', 'In that regard, the recent increase in market-based inflation expectations along the entire maturity distribution to levels closer to our target is a welcome development', 'It signals that investors have become more sanguine about the euro area inflation outlook without pointing – so far at least – to fears of more persistent inflation overshoots that could spiral back into actual price and wage dynamics', 'And since inflation expectations help to determine the real interest rate, higher inflation expectations reinforce the degree of policy accommodation in an environment of low nominal yields, and thus contribute to lifting inflation towards our new symmetric medium-term target of 2%', 'Chart 6 Survey and market-based inflation indicators for the euro area    Left-hand panel:Source: Bloomberg, Refinitiv and Eurosystem staff calculations', 'Notes: SPF stands for Survey of Professional Forecasters', 'The risk adjustment is based on an affine term structure model and fitted to the euro area zero-coupon inflation-linked swaps (ILS) curve', 'The estimation method follows Joslin et al', '(2011)', 'For details, see Camba-Mendez and Werner (2017)', 'Right-hand panel:Source: Bloomberg, Refinitiv, ECB calculations', 'Notes: Probabilities implied by five-year zero-coupon inflation options, smoothed over five business days', 'Risk-neutral probabilities may differ significantly from physical, or true, probabilities', 'Another method of gauging inflation expectations is to rely on survey-based metrics', 'For the euro area, these expectation proxies are derived from surveys of professional forecasters, households and businesses', '[8] Similar to market-based measures, survey-based measures of inflation expectations have exhibited a notable uplift in the wake of the recovery from the pandemic but remain below our target (Chart 6, left panel)', 'In other words, there is currently no indication that elevated inflation rates are becoming entrenched in medium and longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area, entailing risks for price stability', 'On the contrary, recent developments across indicators suggest that investors and professional forecasters are increasingly internalising our new monetary policy strategy as well as our recently revised forward guidance, bringing us closer to our inflation target of 2 percent', 'In short, we will only start raising our key policy rates once we are confident that inflation has durably converged to our target well ahead of the end of our projection horizon, and we judge that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term', 'In an environment of measurable movements in inflation expectations, insights regarding their role in monetary policy transmission remain crucial for the policy deliberations of central banks', 'In the post-pandemic context, it is particularly challenging to discern whether changes in measures of expectations indicate a more fundamental change that may durably impact the transmission of monetary policy', 'So what can research tell us', 'Recent research in this area – including several papers presented at this conference – has helped shed light on how different types of inflation expectations are formed, how reliable the various measures are, and what these findings may imply for the conduct of monetary policy', 'How reliable are surveys of professional forecasters, for example', 'One of the conference papers identifies an intriguing mechanism whereby even rational forecasters might report a biased measure of their true expectations, with individual forecasts over-reacting to private information, while under-reacting to publicly available information', '[9]  Moreover, aggregating inflation expectations as a point estimate can be misleading because it disregards the distribution of inflation expectations', 'For instance, probability distributions of inflation expectations derived from option prices show a clear shift in recent months', 'Following a long period of market-based distributions of inflation expectations being persistently skewed to the downside, the probability of option-implied inflation rates above 2', '0% over the next five years has recently reached its highest level since 2012 at 40%(Chart 6, right panel)', 'Such distributions are likely to matter even more in the case of households and businesses who often lack accurate knowledge of the official inflation rate or even the central bank’s inflation target, resulting in a wide distribution of inflation expectations', 'Indeed, new survey evidence in one of the conference papers confirms that inflation expectations of US firms are far from anchored', '[10]  For central banks, these findings highlight the importance of communicating our monetary policy objectives effectively – an important consideration in our strategy review and in our decision to adopt a symmetric inflation target of 2% over the medium term', '[11] Another conference paper addresses this issue by presenting empirical evidence corroborating the hypothesis that central bank communication focusing on the goals of monetary policy actions is more effective than communication focusing on individual monetary policy instruments', '[12]  Behavioural changes due to the pandemic The second source of uncertainty I would like to discuss today relates to potential behavioural changes induced by the pandemic', 'Microeconomic rigidities such as those stemming from wage- and price-setting behaviour have profound implications for the transmission of monetary policy', 'Collectively, these rigidities play a crucial but subtle role in determining the location and slope of the Phillips curve – a reduced form description of how changes in aggregate demand put pressure on inflation', 'This relationship can arise from underlying structural relations in a wide class of state-of-the-art sticky price models, as one paper at this conference will show', '[13]  Model simulations and recent empirical evidence indicate that the slope of the Phillips curve may have flattened considerably over recent decades, a finding that continues to generate substantial debate in academia and policy circles (Chart 7)', 'Chart 7 Change in the slope of the Phillips curve  (x-axis: log percentage points, y-axis: percentage points)   Source: Costain, J', ', Nakov, A', 'and Petit, B', '(2021), “Flattening of the Phillips Curve with State-Dependent Prices and Wages”, The Economic Journal, July', 'Note: The top panels show scatterplots of the change in inflation and the output gap in US data over the periods 1980-2000 and 2000-2020, respectively', 'The bottom panels illustrate simulated data generated by a model of state-dependent price and wage setting (Costain et al', ', 2021) for the same time periods', 'The analysis indicates that the model explains roughly half of the observed flattening of the Phillips curve', 'According to the model, lower inflation in the second period (2000-2020) has reduced the frequency of price changes, implying a reduced transmission of demand shocks to the aggregate price level', 'Such a change would have significant implications for the conduct of monetary policy', 'When inflation is below target, a flatter structural Phillips curve may imply that a greater degree of policy accommodation is required to return to target', 'In turn, a flatter Phillips curve implies that more forceful monetary policy tightening may be necessary to lower inflation that surpasses the central bank’s target', 'However, like inflation expectations, the slope of the Phillips curve is not directly observable, and estimates differ depending on the models they are derived from', 'Research presented at this conference suggests that one has to be careful in the estimation of the Phillips curve relationship in order to avoid confusing a changing slope with a shift in inflation expectations', '[14]  A further key structural determinant of the slope of the Phillips curve is the rate at which firms reset prices, affecting the responsiveness of the price level to changes in economic activity', 'Some have argued that the low rates of inflation witnessed over the past decade have reduced the rate of price resets, since firms are less likely to find themselves significantly away from their optimal price', '[15]  However, research conducted by the ECB and the PRISMA network on micro-level price data challenges this claim, finding no noticeable slowdown in the rate of price resets (Chart 8)', 'Work in progress in the Eurosystem shows that the rate of price changes may even have increased during the pandemic', 'Chart 8 Frequency of price changes: a comparison of IPN (data: 1996-2001) and PRISMA (data: 2011-2017) results  (percentages)   Source: Gautier et al',

inflation persistence and price rigidity in the euro area by analysing a broad set of macro and micro data covering the period from 1996 until 2001', 'The IPN has concluded its work', 'The PRISMA network was set up in 2018 to deepen the understanding of price-setting behaviour and inflation dynamics in the EU by collecting and studying various types of microdata, including data underlying official price indices such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI), scanner data and online prices, covering the period from 2011 until 2017', 'The frequency of price changes displayed in the chart is measured as the fraction of all prices for each of the 50 product categories in the sample that change on a monthly basis', 'This research is representative of a wider shift in the literature, which increasingly investigates the macroeconomic impact of heterogenous firm-level decisions', 'The impact of such firm-level decisions on macroeconomic outcomes has crucial implications for the transmission of monetary policy decisions to the real economy', 'There is growing evidence that the aggregate change in the price level is not only determined by the average rate of price resets, but rather by the entire distribution of price adjustments', 'For example, a large number of relatively small changes (in absolute value) may imply relatively high stickiness in the aggregate price level', 'By contrast, if firms that are furthest away from their optimum price are more likely to adjust their prices – known in the literature as selection effects – the price level may be more flexible', 'One conference paper that has been written under the PRISMA network finds evidence that the probability of price changes indeed depends on the extent of mispricing both for the United States and the euro area, as indicated by the V-shape in Chart 9', 'The x-axis shows how far a firm’s current price is from its optimal reset price, which proxies the gain from changing the price', 'The y-axis shows the probability of changing the price', 'Firms further away from the optimal reset price are indeed more likely to change prices', 'However, the paper also shows that the probability of adjustment in response to monetary and credit shocks does not depend on the extent of mispricing', 'Hence, the paper finds little evidence that selection contributes significantly to the overall inflation response to an aggregate shock', '[16] Thus, while some degree of state-dependence is present in the micro data, it appears that its effect is muted in the aggregate, rejecting the results of state-dependent models with high selection[17] and favouring models of the “rational-inattention” type with a low degree of selection', '[18]   Chart 9 Evidence of state-dependence: repricing probability as a function of the price gap  (percentage)   Source: Karadi, P', ', Schoenle, R', 'and Wursten, J', '(2021), “Measuring Price Selection in Microdata: It’s Not

consistent with state-dependent price setting: the probability of adjustment steadily increases with the extent of mispricing', 'The extent of mispricing is proxied as a distance from the average price of the same product among those competitors that reset their prices in the same month', 'The measure also controls for the persistent heterogeneity among products and stores by eliminating the impact of product-store fixed effects', 'Additional details on the methodology are available in ECB Working Paper No 2566', 'From a policymaker’s perspective, it is encouraging to witness the efforts to translate the impact of micro-level distributions into macroeconomic representations of policy transmission, for example through the creation of informative statistics based on micro-level data, as done in one of the conference papers', '[19] These findings generate constructive input for our policy discussions on the transmission of monetary policy and, ultimately, help us to improve our knowledge regarding the underlying drivers of inflation dynamics in the euro area', '[20]  Conclusion Let me conclude', 'Current inflationary pressures in the euro area are driven by pandemic-related factors that can be expected to largely fade out over the course of next year', 'Overreacting to such short-term volatility would be harmful and risk jeopardising the ongoing economic recovery, which is why the ECB’s monetary policy remains focused on fulfilling its medium-term price stability mandate', 'Nonetheless, significant uncertainty remains as to how persistent some of the current price pressures will prove to be', 'The ECB therefore continues to carefully monitor inflationary developments in the euro area, with a particular focus on second-round effects, to determine whether the headwinds that have exerted downward pressure on inflation for much of the past decade are still present, or whether they may reverse in the aftermath of the pandemic', 'The cyclical and specific pandemic factors will increasingly be overlaid by structural changes, which can go in different directions', '[21] Structural factors such as globalisation, the fight against climate change, demographic trends and digitalisation are likely to continue to affect prices and price-setting, and hence the transmission of our policy, but the direction is still unclear', '[22]  High-quality academic research into the underlying drivers of inflation dynamics hence remains a vital input for our monetary policy deliberations', 'I therefore look forward to hearing more about the insightful

for five weeks now shares have been denominated in euro on most European stock exchanges', 'Although not yet embodied in the physical form of new banknotes and coins, there is no doubt that the new currency is set to play an important role, both in the euro area and beyond', 'The euro is a symbol of the achievements of Europeans in the pursuit of common goals', 'It is unprecedented in European history', 'After years of intensive preparations and successful efforts towards convergence, the single monetary policy for the entire euro area is being determined by the European Central Bank (ECB)', 'The Governing Council of the ECB, which comprises the Governors of the 11 national central banks of the participating Member States plus the six members of the Executive Board of the ECB, has assumed this responsibility and is in charge of monetary policy decisions for the euro area', 'Decisions by the Governing Council will be implemented via the Eurosystem - that is, the ECB and the 11 participating national central banks (NCBs)', 'Indeed, the introduction of the euro marks the culmination of much successful preparatory work over a period of many years', 'This has been reflected in the positive way in which financial markets have received the euro in the first five weeks of Monetary Union', 'Moreover, the enormous technical and logistical challenges posed during the changeover weekend at the start of the year have been surmounted', 'Today, I shall deal with the role of monetary policy in general', 'More in particular, I shall describe the main features of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, which underlie our single monetary policy', 'Against this background, I shall briefly explain recent monetary policy decisions adopted by the Governing Council of the ECB and its assessment of the current economic situation', 'Finally, I shall summarise how I view the international role of the euro and that of the ECB', 'The role of monetary policy  A successful monetary policy must always be forward-looking, acting to contain threats to price stability before they become entrenched', 'Therefore, today I should also like to look to the future', 'Monetary Union is a unique and significant achievement', 'It promises a credible and lasting environment of price stability for almost 300 million people', 'This stable environment is the foundation for sustainable economic growth, better employment prospects and improvements in the standard of living throughout the euro area', 'Price stability is a necessary condition for improved economic performance in all these areas', 'I am confident that the single monetary policy will make the greatest possible contribution in this regard', 'The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy announced by the Governing Council last year, and which is now guiding monetary policy decisions, was designed with this goal in mind', \"Nevertheless, monetary policy alone - however well designed and implemented - cannot solve Europe's economic problems\", 'Appropriate fiscal policies and structural reforms implemented by national governments are vital and much progress is required in these areas', 'Moreover, continued wage moderation in both the public and private sectors would contribute to reducing the unacceptably high level of unemployment in many parts of the euro area', 'Unemployment in the euro area is largely structural in origin', 'Implementing too lax a monetary policy will not solve this problem, but rather exacerbate it over the medium term, as inflation distorts investment and saving decisions, raises the risk premium in long-term interest rates and undermines the allocative efficiency of the price mechanism', 'Only effective structural policies that improve the flexibility and efficiency of labour and goods markets can reduce unemployment in a successful and lasting manner', 'I appreciate that these structural reforms are not always easy to implement, not least because the benefits they yield occur mainly in the medium to long term', 'However, they are unavoidable', 'In those euro area countries that have taken up the challenge of structural reform, unemployment has fallen significantly', \"Other euro area countries should and must take note: structural reform throughout the euro area is fundamental to the success of Monetary Union and to improving Europe's economic performance\", 'The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy  The Treaty on European Union assigned the ESCB the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area', 'You may rest assured that the Governing Council of the ECB is totally committed to fulfilling this mandate', 'In order to meet this commitment, the Governing Council has adopted a stability-oriented monetary policy strategy consisting of three main elements', 'First, in order to give clear guidance in relation to expectations of future price developments, the Governing Council has announced a quantitative definition of its primary objective', 'Defining price stability also serves the principles of transparency and accountability', \"It clarifies how the Treaty's mandate is interpreted by the Governing Council and gives the public clear guidance concerning its assessment of the success of the single monetary policy\", 'Price stability has therefore been defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%', 'Needless to say, deflation - that is, a persistent fall in the price level - would not be consistent with price stability', 'The annual rate of inflation in the most recent available data, measured on this harmonised basis, is consistent with the definition of price stability', 'The Eurosystem has therefore enjoyed the good fortune to assume monetary sovereignty in the euro area in an environment of price stability, owing to the successful process of disinflation and convergence achieved by national central banks during the last decade', 'Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term', 'This reflects the need for monetary policy to be forward-looking and to have a medium-term orientation', 'It recognises the fact that monetary policy is not able to control all short-term movements in the price level', \"To maintain price stability according to this published definition, the Governing Council's strategy relies on two pillars\", 'First, a prominent role has been assigned to money, in recognition of the monetary origins of inflation over the longer term', 'This prominent role is reflected in the announcement of a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate, namely M3', 'The first reference value has been set at an annual rate of 4½%', 'The reference value for M3 is consistent with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, while allowing for sustainable output growth and taking account of the trend decline in the velocity of circulation of M3', 'Monetary policy will not react to deviations of monetary growth from the reference value in a \"mechanistic\" way', 'In the first instance, such deviations will be thoroughly analysed for the signals that they offer with regard to the prospects for price developments', 'If the deviation points to a threat to price stability, monetary policy will react in a manner appropriate to counter this threat, rather than attempting to eliminate the deviation of monetary growth from the reference value in the short term', 'The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole', 'The Governing Council of the ECB recognises that it is important, in parallel with the assessment of monetary growth in relation to the reference value, to look at a wide range of other economic and financial indicators, including economic forecasts', 'This systematic analysis of all other relevant information about economic and financial conditions will ensure that the Governing Council is as well informed as possible when taking monetary policy decisions', 'Recent developments in monetary policy  Co-operation among European national central banks has been close for a long time and, among the NCBs of the countries participating in Stage Three, has become increasingly so in recent years and months', 'The co-ordinated interest rate cut at the beginning of December last year is an illustration of this co-operation', 'This co-ordinated interest rate move was thoroughly discussed by the members of the Governing Council of the ECB', 'De jure, the decision to change interest rates had to be taken by the national central banks, but, de facto, Monetary Union existed in all but name prior to its formal implementation on 1 January 1999', 'At its first December meeting, the Governing Council made a thorough assessment of the latest monetary data and other economic indicators, noting in particular the decline in business confidence in the euro area arising, in part, from the deteriorating external environment', 'This deterioration in the international economy has its origins, to a large extent, in the Asian and Russian financial crises', 'Following its appraisal of both pillars of the monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council concluded that key central bank interest rates of 3% would best serve the maintenance of price stability in the euro area over the medium term', 'National central banks adjusted their interest rates accordingly', 'This co-ordinated interest rate move allowed the ECB to announce that the new level of interest rates would prevail \"for the foreseeable future\"', 'In other words, in the absence of further disturbances to the economy or the emergence of new and unanticipated threats to price stability, this level of interest rates should be appropriate to fulfil the primary objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term', 'This announcement helped to resolve some uncertainty at a time when the practical, technical and logistical tasks necessitated by the changeover weekend were uppermost in our minds and in those of market participants', 'Following the second Governing Council meeting in December, the President of the ECB was therefore able to announce that the interest rate on the first main refinancing operation of the Eurosystem would also be 3%', 'Moreover, the interest rates for the deposit and marginal lending facilities - which, in normal circumstances, would constitute the upper and lower bounds for overnight market interest rates - were set at 2% and 4', '5% respectively', 'As a transitional measure to help the financial system adjust to the new institutional environment resulting from the transition to Stage Three, from 4 January until 21 January a narrower band of 2', '75% to 3', '25% has been set for the rates on the deposit and marginal lending facilities', 'During the first few days of Stage Three we observed a relatively large recourse by credit institutions to these facilities', \"This was to be expected, given the relatively narrow spread between the Eurosystem's marginal lending facility and the overnight money market rate\", 'Although the narrow corridor is intended to facilitate the transition by market participants to the new regime, over a longer period of time such a measure would hamper the development of an efficiently functioning euro area money market', 'At its meeting on 21 January, the Governing Council reviewed the experience with the functioning of the euro area-wide money market since the beginning of the year', 'It noted that the few difficulties encountered by some market participants with the functioning of the euro area-wide money market and, in particular, with the cross-border flow of liquidity, have diminished substantially over time', 'As a consequence, overall, the integration of the euro area money market has therefore rapidly reached a satisfactory state', 'Against this background, there was no need to continue the application of the narrow interest rate corridor beyond the date of 21 January', \"Assessment of the current economic situation  At the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB of this year so far, it was confirmed that the 3% rate would apply to the Eurosystem's next main refinancing operations\", \"This level is based on the Governing Council's current assessment of the economic situation, viewed from the perspective of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy\", 'First, monetary growth in recent months has been broadly in line with the quantitative reference value', 'This, together with further analysis of the monetary data, signals that monetary developments are consistent with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term', 'Of course, monetary growth relative to the reference value should always be interpreted in a medium-term context', 'Short-run deviations from the reference value are inevitable and, while being monitored and assessed carefully, would not automatically signal an immediate threat to price stability', 'Nevertheless, it is reassuring that the three-month moving average of the annual growth rates of M3 up to December 1998 stood at 4', '7%, very close to the reference value of 4½%', 'Second, as regards the broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments, a number of indicators have recently proved noteworthy', 'Following the co-ordinated interest rate cut at the beginning of December, long-term interest rates have also fallen, suggesting that financial markets viewed the cut favourably and considered it to be consistent with the credible maintenance of price stability over the medium term', 'According to revised Eurostat estimates, real GDP growth remained broadly robust in the third quarter of 1998, while in more recent months activity may have slowed down', 'Such a slowdown is apparent in industrial production growth up to November 1998, in particular in the intermediate goods sector, which is particularly sensitive to any deterioration in the external environment', 'However, at the same time, production of capital goods and consumer durables has continued to expand rather strongly', 'A similar pattern can be observed in the decline in industrial confidence that has been apparent in the second half of 1998 in the euro area, while, however, stabilising in January 1999', 'On the other hand, consumer confidence in the euro area continued to increase in December and in January; it has now exceeded the peak level reached in 1990, with retail sales up to November showing continued solid growth and car sales growing strongly during the last months of 1998', 'Finally, the mixed picture is confirmed by other data', 'Order books, which overall declined slightly further in December, apparently increased again in January, particularly with respect to export orders', 'Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector, which started to decrease in the third quarter recovered again thereafter, while December data on unemployment appear to suggest that the decline in unemployment rates stalled around year-end', 'Therefore, with regard to the cyclical situation, recent data seem to confirm our earlier assessment that there are downside risks for output growth and that production may have slowed down around the turn of the year', 'Nonetheless, there are also no clear signals as yet of a stronger than expected weakening in output growth', 'Given this mixed picture, it should be emphasised that further thorough analysis and very close monitoring of underlying trends are needed before any conclusions can be drawn concerning the broad outlook for 1999 and 2000', 'Against this background, the annual rate of increase in the HICP for the euro area slowed further in December, falling to 0', '8% as compared with 0', '9% in November and 1', '0% in October', 'This reduction in the rate of increase of the HICP resulted from further moderation of food price increases and continued falls in energy prices', 'On balance, the general environment continued to suggest that there is no significant upward or downward pressure on the price level', 'Of course, the Governing Council is fully aware that potential risks to price stability do exist', 'On the one hand, downward risks could materialise if import or producer prices were to fall further', \"On the other, fiscal indiscipline by national governments failing to respect the Stability and Growth Pact or inflationary wage settlements could threaten the 2% upper bound of the Eurosystem's published definition of price stability\", 'In addition, exchange rate trends need to be monitored closely given their importance for domestic price developments', 'The international role of the euro and the ECB  Changes in the external environment - that is, in the economic condition and performance of countries outside the euro area - may affect the outlook for price developments within the euro area, and thereby the conduct of the single monetary policy', 'The effects of financial crises on external demand and business confidence are a notable recent example', 'However, this relationship works in both directions', 'The introduction of the euro has created a single currency area of a size and importance and with a population broadly similar to the United States', 'An event of this magnitude is likely to have major implications for the rest of the world, especially the international financial system', 'In the remainder of my speech, I shall consider some of these implications', 'In its monetary policy strategy, the Eurosystem deliberately does not specify a target for the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar or the Japanese yen', 'Although it will always stand ready to exchange views with other central banks concerning the development of exchange rates, there are no explicit or implicit target zones for the euro exchange rate against non-EU currencies', 'The euro area is a large, relatively closed economy, similar in this respect to the United States', 'Pursuing a target for the euro exchange rate could easily jeopardise the maintenance of price stability', 'The level of interest rates required to sustain an exchange rate target may, in some cases, not be that which best serves the maintenance of price stability over the medium term', 'I might add that it may also conflict with the achievement of other domestic policy objectives', 'It could be very painful if it were necessary to raise interest rates in a recession in order to defend the exchange rate of the euro', 'Finally, it should be acknowledged that today we are living in a world with high capital mobility', 'Exchange rate arrangements that could be implemented thirty years ago may no longer be feasible', 'The required amount of foreign exchange reserves could simply be too large', \"Within the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy, the euro exchange rate is the outcome of current and expected economic policies and developments in both the euro area and elsewhere, and of the market participants' perception of these policies and developments\", 'Supporting the Eurosystem\\'s approach, the Ministers of Finance, who are assigned ultimate responsibility for the exchange rate of the euro by the Maastricht Treaty, have agreed not to issue so-called \"general orientations\" for the exchange rate policy to the Eurosystem other than in clearly exceptional circumstances, such as when there is a substantial and persistent misalignment of the euro against other currencies', 'However, the absence of a target for the exchange rate of the euro against major international currencies does not imply that the ECB ignores or is indifferent to the exchange rate of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar or the Japanese yen', 'As I already said earlier, the exchange rate will be monitored as one of the indicators of monetary policy, within the broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments that constitutes one pillar of the overall strategy', 'Nor does the absence of exchange rate targets suggest that these rates will necessarily be unstable or volatile', 'On the contrary, the pursuit of stability-oriented monetary and fiscal policies puts in place one of the major prerequisites for stable euro exchange rates', \"The Eurosystem's stability-oriented monetary policy strategy is a significant contribution in this regard\", 'Absolute stability of the exchange rate is, of course, impossible to guarantee', 'It would not even be desirable if, for example, the United States and the euro area were to go through business cycles that were not fully synchronised', 'This possibility cannot be ruled out, as even recent history has shown', 'We are aware that the emergence of an international role for the euro may sometimes complicate the conduct of monetary policy if a significant proportion of the money stock is circulating outside the euro area', 'Nevertheless, the Eurosystem will accept the international role of the euro as it develops as a result of market forces', 'To the extent that the Eurosystem is successful in meeting its mandate and maintaining price stability, it will also automatically foster the use of the euro as an international currency', 'The pace at which the euro will emerge as an international currency is hard to predict', \"If history is taken as a guide, it will be a gradual process, but it is possible that, in today's more dynamic and flexible financial markets, the euro could assume a prominent role more rapidly than past experience might suggest\", 'Finally, I should like to discuss briefly the role of the ECB in international co-operation', 'As the representative of a monetary union comparable in size and importance to the United States and as the central bank managing a currency that is likely to play a large and increasing international role, the ECB will inevitably play an important role in the international financial system', 'The ECB will embrace the implied responsibility, but at the same time it will have to be modest and realistic in its actions on the international stage', 'Its role will develop over time, drawing on the experience of those national central banks that have played an important international role in the past', 'At the end of last year, the ECB was accorded observer status at the International Monetary Fund (IMF)', 'Full membership of the IMF is restricted to individual nations', 'Nevertheless, this observer status will allow the ECB to participate fully in the relevant work and assessment by the Fund of economic policies in the euro area and beyond', 'The ECB also participates in the work of the G-7, the G-10, the Bank for International Settlements and the OECD', 'It enjoys good bilateral relations with other central banks throughout the world', 'The ECB stands ready to participate fully in, and contribute to, international policy discussions', 'It will, of course, offer expertise and exchange views, when and where appropriate', 'However, in general, the best contribution the ECB can make to a stable international monetary system, including stable exchange rates and well-functioning international capital markets, is to maintain price stability within the euro area', 'Fulfilling the mandate assigned to the ESCB by the Treaty on European Union will help the ECB to meet its international responsibilities', 'Concluding remarks  The euro has arrived', 'The Governing Council of the ECB has taken up the reins of monetary sovereignty in the euro area and a truly single monetary policy has been in place for five weeks', 'For those of us who have been involved in the long and at times arduous preparations for Monetary Union, this is an occasion which provides a sense of satisfaction', 'However, as I have outlined in this speech, in many ways the real work of the ECB is only just beginning', 'The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy is in place', 'I am confident that this framework will enable the Governing Council to fulfil the Treaty mandate of maintaining price stability', 'Meeting this mandate will ensure that the single monetary policy makes its best possible contribution to improving the standard of living in the euro area and helping to ensure the stability of the international financial system'])\n",

tightening episodes', 'The first relates to the exceptional speed of the current hiking cycle compared to relevant precedents in recent history', 'The second relates to structural shifts that may have altered the transmission of a given policy impulse in the euro area', 'And the third factor is the implications of hiking cycles being synchronised across the major central banks', 'The sharpest policy tightening on record Comparing the current hiking cycle to previous ones is challenging for three reasons', 'First, the current rate hiking cycle started only six months ago, with the bulk of the pipeline effects still expected to be realised over the coming months and years', 'Second, in order to understand how monetary policy is filtering through to the economy, it is important to consider not only the level that interest rates have reached today, but also the speed at which these have been raised over a relatively compressed period of time', 'The cumulative 300 basis point hike since July 2022 is the fastest rate hiking cycle in euro area history', 'Third, the start of the hiking cycle put an end to an era of negative policy rates and marked the first rate hike since 2011', 'As the available literature studying negative rates has found, pronounced non-linearities were evident in the relative impact of equally sized rate reductions depending on whether these occurred in positive or negative territory', 'This means that one may legitimately expect such non-linear effects to also be relevant in moving rates back into positive territory after a long period below the zero line', 'In other words, the rate hiking cycle may not only differ from those observed in history quantitatively, but also qualitatively', 'Chart 17 shows that the current rate path outpaces any historical example given in the picture, at least over the earlier phases of progression for which they are comparable', 'That said, the path is relatively similar to two historical precedents at least (the response by the Bundesbank to the inflationary risks emanating from the German unification in the early 1990s and the rapid normalisation of policy rates by the ECB following monetary union over 1999-2000)', 'However, at least over the period for which we can draw comparisons, the impact of our rate hikes on lending rates and on credit volumes has been stronger and more rapid', 'It is interesting to note that, despite following similar trajectories over the period preceding the start of the respective hiking cycles, the evolution of total credit to firms is already showing signs of moderation, whereas it took longer for commercial credit to reach an inflection point in the other two episodes', 'Of course, whether these tighter conditions will succeed in

historic pace', 'The common global factor is also evident in the behaviour of asset prices, with euro area asset prices having become more sensitive to US macro-economic news', 'Empirically, medium-term spillovers from the Federal Reserve tightening to euro area real activity and inflation are found to be large and, along some dimensions, in fact as large as the effects on the US economy

another challenge that compels us to reassess our modelling frameworks and to augment them with further evidence on the evolution of the monetary policy transmission process', 'One example is the structure of private sector debt', 'For instance, as policy rates increase, more and more firms can be expected to opt for shorter maturity and flexible rate debt, which could magnify the impact of monetary policy on investment', 'Firms have already shifted their debt structure away from long maturities', 'In 2021, about 25 per cent of new loans had a maturity of more than one year, whereas reversion towards levels closer to those observed around 10-15 years ago, characterised by shorter maturities and more recourse to flexible rate debt (Chart 19, left panel)', 'Further shifts might be expected in response to the current rate hiking cycle', 'Such behaviour could translate into a stronger sensitivity of the interest expenses of firms to monetary policy changes', 'This in turn means a stronger contraction of corporate cash flows when policy rates increase', 'Over time, firms that already face financing frictions can be affected more by this “floating-rate channel” of monetary policy, amplifying the conventional monetary policy transmission', 'Chart 19      Share of new loans to firms by fixation period (left panel); relation between firms’ default risk and net leverage by

interest rates (Chart 19, right panel)', 'Financial intermediaries judge corporates by their probabilities of default and will likely curtail credit for those borrowers deemed to be too risky: a commonly used measure of borrower risk is the one-year-ahead expected default frequencies (EDFs)', 'In line with the Merton-type model underlying the computations, data on individual companies point to a positive relation between EDFs and net leverage', 'What can also be observed however – at least in some samples examined – is that the sensitivity of EDFs to net leverage also shifts upwards when debt servicing costs increase', 'This may suggest that an environment of elevated debt servicing costs might also translate into higher probabilities of default and thus potential increases in companies financing constraints', '[24]  Moreover, firm financing structures have not only changed in relation to maturity structures, but also in terms of the relative role of different debt instruments', 'While firm financing remains predominantly bank-based in the euro area, bond financing has increased considerably over the last fifteen years (Chart 20)', 'Prior to the onset of the ECB’s monetary policy normalisation, the share of bonds had reached a peak of about 30 per cent in 2021', 'Increases in bond financing largely reflected credit supply restrictions: after the great financial crisis and during the ensuing sovereign debt crisis, banks curtailed their credit supply to the economy and large firms used the “spare tyre” of bond markets to finance themselves', '[25] Thereafter, developments were helped by corporate bond purchase programmes of the ECB and overall favourable financing conditions', 'Chart 20   Ratio of bonds over loans in euro area NFCs  (ratio)   Sources: ECB (BSI, CSEC)', 'Notes: Data cover NFCs', 'Loans and bonds are notional stocks', 'The latest observation is for December 2022', 'As firm financing switches from bank to bond financing, the sensitivity of economic activity to changes in the short-term policy rate can decrease, since the higher duration of bonds insulates the stock of debt from rate changes', 'However, at the same time, the total sensitivity to movements of the long-term policy rate and of overall yield curve might increase, via new issuance', 'The differences in transmission, whereby firms using more bonds are more directly affected by changes in long-term rates rather than short-term rates, reflects this fact that the typical maturity of corporate bonds is higher than for loans', '[26]  Firm financing via bond markets can be fragile in a context of policy normalisation and thereby can amplify de-risking (Chart 21)', 'As the normalisation process of monetary policy started and rates increased across the whole term structure, bond issuance dried up during the course of 2022, thus translating into a decrease in the share of bonds relative to loan', 'Furthermore, firm-level data suggest that the ongoing monetary normalisation is not neutral with respect to the risk profile of bond issuers, as riskier firms have more vigorously reduced their share of new bonds since June 2022', 'Given the greater sensitivity of bond markets to risk over this period, the role of banks in financing the economy became more prominent', 'More recently, the rise in bank lending rates has narrowed the gap between the cost of bond and bank finance, with some high-grade issuers returning to the bond market in January 2023', 'Finally, a stronger recourse to bond markets also exposes firms more directly to foreign

monetary policy normalisation, euro area households also tend to be more likely to initiate flexible rate mortgages than in the recent past', 'Recent empirical work indeed suggests that across euro area countries, those with historically higher shares of flexible rate mortgages also experienced stronger contractions of consumption following a tightening in monetary policy (Chart 23, right panel)', '[27] A generalised increase in the share of flexible rates of mortgages could thus translate into an amplified monetary policy transmission mechanism to consumption', 'At the same time, the significant amount of excess savings amassed by euro area households during the COVID-19 pandemic (Chart 24) will continue to act as a buffer for consumption during this period of high inflation and will exert downward pressure on the price of capital', 'Both effects could thus dampen the transmission of higher policy rates to the economy and inflation', 'However, support for higher demand may only be partial: first, a large share of excess savings accumulated during the pandemic accrued to the wealthiest households with a lower propensity to consume and, second, a substantial part of the excess savings is likely to be reabsorbed via weaker borrowing dynamics and – among lower-income households – to finance the price increases for essentials like food and heating', 'In this context, it is also important to keep in mind that euro area households generally have lower levels of indebtedness than those in the United States, which may explain part of the difference in transmission in the

of euro area banks will affect monetary policy transmission', 'Against the backdrop of regulatory developments, the launch of European banking supervision and enhanced market scrutiny, the euro area banking sector has become better capitalised and more attentive to the early identification of risks and vulnerabilities', 'Greater bank capitalisation, in theory, should allow for a smooth transmission of monetary policy to lending conditions, since the risk of a credit crunch as rates increase is reduced', '[28] The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of euro area banks has increased substantially since the establishment of European banking supervision (Chart 25)', 'This allowed them to become part of the solution during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting the euro area economy’s unprecedented need for emergency liquidity lending', 'The upgrade in regulatory and supervisory oversight has led to more prudent risk management practices, contributing to tightening credit standards even in periods when the latter were eased on the back of monetary policy accommodation (Chart 26)', 'The decrease in the riskiness of loan portfolios was accompanied by a more efficient unwinding of legacy assets (Chart 27), ensuring that the strengthening of banks’ intermediation capacity was persistent and resilient to adverse developments', '[29] Even now in a context of monetary policy tightening, the additional capital buffers and prudential practices cultivated over the past decade act as a natural bulwark against an unwarranted and disorderly deterioration in financing conditions for the real economy', 'The experience during the pandemic has also shown that micro and macroprudential policy measures can complement monetary policy, adding to the overall resilience of bank intermediation in the euro area', 'As euro area banks have adapted to the evolving regulatory and supervisory landscape, monetary policy, micro and macroprudential authorities have refined their understanding and shared experience of how the different policy areas can complement each other to achieve common goals', '[30] For instance, there is evidence that capital relief measures at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic increased the effectiveness of targeted longer-term refinancing operations in supporting the flow of bank credit to the real economy', '[31]   Chart 25   Evolution of

context, the funding cost relief brought about by monetary policy easing between 2014 and 2021 bought time for banks to improve and adapt their business models to the evolving landscape, leaving them in a more comfortable position when the general level of interest rates started to rise', 'A structurally more profitable banking system is inherently more resilient and less dependent on public support measures', '[32] In the context of the ongoing monetary policy tightening, this will help to preserve a well-functioning bank-based transmission of monetary policy, reducing the risks that a lower risk appetite of financial intermediaries amid the cooling off of the economy may set the ground for an uneven transmission of monetary policy', 'This being said, pockets of vulnerability

sensitive to monetary policy, implying a weaker interest rate channel of transmission', 'This hypothesis is borne out by recent empirical evidence subdividing regional GVA into its capital- and labour-intensive components (Chart 30, right panel)', 'This breakdown shows that the peak impact of an exogenous change in policy interest rates on capital-intensive output is double the peak impact

prolongs the real effects of monetary policy', '[37] Whether these patterns have intensified during the years since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out remains an open issue, as the drop in activity in

Lewis and Clark set off to explore the unknown American West, reaching the Columbia River on the Pacific coast more than 200 years ago', 'Today, our exploration is more of the intellectual type, and what we are investigating and seeking to understand better encompasses the whole world, or rather “a globalised economy”, as the title of the conference says', 'It is a great pleasure for me to be here and share with you and the distinguished members of this panel some thoughts on the implications of globalisation for monetary policy', 'The themes of this conference, the challenges of globalisation for the advanced economies, the severity and correction of global imbalances, and the evolving roles of the dollar and the euro in the international financial system, have been the subject of enriching and stimulating discussions during the previous sessions today', 'In my remarks, I will try to bring together these three themes from the perspectives of the euro area and of the central banker', 'What are the challenges of globalisation for the euro area economies and for the conduct of the ECB’s monetary policy', 'In answering this question, I will address the following specific issues:    the consequences of globalisation for inflation and its dynamics;   the implications of globalisation for the size and sustainability of global imbalances;   the appropriate policies, globally and in the euro area, in order to effectively contribute to the orderly correction of global imbalances; and   the role and conduct of the ECB’s monetary policy in a globalised economy', 'Globalisation: definition and measurement     Let me start by defining the term globalisation', 'Various definitions have been proposed which overlap and differ somewhat in terms of scope and emphasis', 'I will define globalisation as the increasing integration, and thus interdependence, of national economies and the growing exchanges of technologies, information, ideas and cultures across national borders', 'These processes are not new, but they have gained momentum and become more pervasive in recent years, affecting all aspects of people’s lives around the world', 'Advances in information and communication technology as well as a growing political consensus concerning the benefits of globalisation have contributed to the accelerating pace of integration of markets worldwide', 'The changes brought about by globalisation may create the impression that traditional economic reasoning and historical statistical relationships do not always hold', 'Globalisation, therefore, may pose challenges for policy-makers and require us to deepen our understanding of the functioning of our economies, to increase our awareness of the evolving economic processes and even to reconsider how to use the available policy instruments in a changing world', 'What Heraclitus, a compatriot of mine, noted a long time ago, applies today more than ever before: “The only constant is change”', 'Globalisation has indeed speeded up over the past decade and especially in the last five years', 'To show this concretely, we need to quantify and measure this phenomenon', 'In order to do this we can adopt a somewhat more specific concept and a quantitative, operational definition such as the one presented in the latest World Economic Outlook published by the IMF, which defines globalisation as “the acceleration in the pace of growth of international trade in goods, services, and financial assets relative to the rate of growth in domestic trade”', 'These are quantities and processes we can measure', 'Let us look at some charts', 'The value of all world exports of goods and services relative to world GDP has increased by ten percentage points (from 19% to 29%) over the past 10-15 years (see Chart 3) and it is expected to continue to grow steadily until the end of the decade', 'Even more impressive is the acceleration in total Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) relative to world GDP (see Chart 4)', 'Since the late 1990s, the pace of integration in the world economy, as illustrated by the stock of inward FDI as a percent of GDP, has accelerated substantially, particularly in non-Japan Asia and in the new Member States of the European Union (see Chart 5)', 'The charts for FDI implicitly incorporate the associated exchanges of technology, information and know-how and other factors that have strengthened the interdependence of our economies', 'Statistics and charts on the movement of people and the exchange of ideas, information and technology are more difficult to come by, but I believe that they would give the same sense of the velocity of the process', 'Globalisation and inflation dynamics    What are the implications of globalisation for the functioning and performance of national economies and for the conduct of economic and monetary policies', 'Can we measure its overall effects on key macroeconomic aggregates, such as inflation and output growth, of individual countries', 'These are broad and challenging questions', 'I will first focus on one issue that has received attention recently and is relevant for monetary policy: the effects of globalisation on inflation and its dynamics', 'Globalisation has two main direct effects on inflation, which partly counterbalance each other', 'On the one hand, some resources are becoming less scarce on a global scale, notably investment opportunities and skilled labour', 'On the other hand, other resources have become scarcer relative to world demand: these are raw materials and basic commodities, most importantly oil and other sources of energy', 'Let us look at each aspect in turn', 'The integration of an enormous reserve of low-cost, skilled labour in the international economy has put downward pressure on import prices of manufactured goods and on wage demands in industrial economies', 'As a consequence, the prices of a wide range of manufactured goods have been declining', 'Furthermore, through various channels this process of wage moderation and reduced inflationary pressure in the manufacturing sector has affected wage dynamics also in the services sector mainly as a result of outsourcing, especially in English-speaking countries', 'These effects of global integration have helped reduce inflationary pressures', 'It is difficult, however, to estimate the size of their impact with great precision', 'At the same time, certain other resources have become scarcer: the integration of rapidly growing large emerging market economies has put upward pressure on energy and commodity prices', 'This impact is more visible and relatively easier to quantify', 'In the euro area, the trend and dynamics of the consumer price level (as measured by the HICP, that is, the harmonised index of consumer prices) and of the import prices of energy, raw materials and manufactured goods (as measured by the respective import unit value indices) have been very diverse over the past decade, especially since 1999', 'As shown in Chart 6, since that year the import price of energy products has more than tripled, reflecting the effects of both demand and supply-side factors', 'The import price index of manufactured products, by contrast, has increased only moderately and indeed it has declined slightly since 2001', 'These developments suggest that the downward pressure on the overall consumer price inflation also reflects, to a considerable extent, the containment of domestic wage increases in industrial countries as a result of the strengthening of global competition', 'So far the manufacturing-price and the wage-containing effects on inflation of globalisation seem to have partly counterbalanced inflationary pressures arising from the substantial increases in commodity prices, partly induced by globalisation', 'A pertinent policy question is: for how long and by how much will global competition continue to contain inflation in industrial countries', 'The answer to this question is not straightforward', 'To begin with, the overall impact of globalisation on inflation cannot be accurately estimated although several estimates have been produced of some of its partial effects', 'For example, IMF staff have estimated that globalisation, through its direct effects on non-oil import prices, has reduced inflation by a quarter of a percentage point per year on average in the advanced economies', 'But the total impact is more difficult to estimate and disentangle from the favourable influences on the recent inflation performance exerted by the significant increases in productivity growth and the enhanced credibility of monetary policy', 'But if it is difficult to assess quantitatively the overall impact of globalisation on inflation, it is more difficult to predict to what extent globalisation will apply downward pressure in the future and for how long', 'While acknowledging that globalisation has helped to contain inflation in many sectors and in advanced economies, and will probably continue to so, we cannot rely on it to keep inflation under control independently of global cyclical positions and monetary conditions', 'Before addressing these issues, it is interesting to point to an attempt made to identify a relationship between inflation and an index measuring the extent to which a country’s economy is globalised', 'Chart 7 shows a simple scatter diagram of the ranking of the 62 “most globalised” countries according to the annual survey conducted by AT Kearney together with the Foreign Policy magazine, against those countries’ inflation rate in 2005, which is the last year of the survey', 'This chart suggests that, indeed, the countries ranking highest among the most globalised ones tend to have lower inflation rates, while the “least globalised” ones have higher and more diverse rates of consumer price inflation', 'Needless to say, the estimated relationship between inflation and a country’s globalisation ranking is only indicative of the influence of globalisation on price developments, since it does not account for the effects of other determinants of inflation in each country', 'In addition to the effects of globalisation on inflation through the channels I previously described, globalisation can affect both long-term inflation and its short-term dynamics by affecting a country’s potential growth as well as global potential growth and the movements of capital and liquidity across borders', 'Recent research at the BIS and by other economists has tried to conceptualise these effects and estimate global potential growth and the associated “global output gap”, pointing to evidence that the degree of global economic slack could be becoming an important factor influencing domestic cyclical conditions', 'Such calculations may further explain why global inflationary pressures have been rather subdued, with few signs of “second-round” effects from the sharp rise in oil prices over the past two years, partly reflecting the effects of globalisation on the demand side of the oil market', 'They may also help explain why inflationary pressures may be increasing in the coming quarters as the global economy continues to expand at a robust pace, greater than the estimated range of rates of global potential growth', 'At the same time, it should be perfectly clear that the uncertainty surrounding estimates of the rate of global potential growth (and of the global output gap) is considerable and obviously exceeds the uncertainty associated with the estimated potential growth rate of a national economy', 'Consequently, the usefulness of such measures is rather limited in practice and extreme caution is warranted in deriving conclusions about their impact on the dynamics of inflation', 'Ultimately, global inflation will be determined over the long term by the trend increase in global liquidity', 'The relationship between global trend money growth and long-term inflation will depend, however, on the way globalisation affects the rate of expansion of the productive capacity of all economies as well as on its effects on the factors and mechanisms that determine the “velocity of circulation of global money”', 'This simple conceptual framework points to the usefulness of examining the determinants of global portfolio allocation patterns and it can also help explain the observed long-term statistical relationship between global inflation and money creation', 'Overall, apart from a few episodes, there was a positive correlation between long-term inflation and trend money growth in industrial countries until the mid-1990s (see Chart 8)', 'Since that time, money growth has increased persistently, while inflation has remained subdued', 'While competitive pressures resulting from globalisation seem to have at least partly contributed to containing consumer price inflation in recent years, the wide availability of financial capital at low interest rates across the largest international financial markets has also contributed to the significant rise in the prices of various assets', 'In particular, house prices in many industrial countries, including several euro area countries, have risen at unusually fast rates in recent years, supporting economic activity through various channels', 'It is interesting to note that, over this period, house price increases were highly correlated across countries, a rather surprising result considering that housing is not a traded asset', 'This result reflects, to a considerable extent, the very favourable financing conditions that have prevailed in most industrial countries over the past few years, as the relatively low level of consumer price inflation allowed the maintenance of accommodative monetary policies', 'Therefore, abundant liquidity and low interest rates contributed to asset price increases, but their effects on consumer prices were contained', 'More analysis and better understanding of the links between money and credit growth, on the one hand, and asset price increases and consumer price inflation, on the other, are clearly warranted in a globalised economy marked by increased competition and productivity growth', 'Globalisation and external imbalances    The two forces I mentioned earlier – rapid growth in large emerging market economies that have become integrated in the world economy combined with the substantial increase in energy and commodity prices – have resulted in large excess savings, especially in East Asia and in oil-exporting countries', 'These excess savings (that is, savings greater than the investment opportunities at home have been channelled to industrial countries, notably the United States, financing its increasing current account deficit, which in 2005 reached a historic record, exceeding USD 800 billion, or around 6', '4% of GDP', 'In the US, the main factors driving the widening of its current account deficit in 2005 were household borrowing and fiscal deficits, while the corporate sector remained a net saver', 'Is the whole world contributing to these imbalances', 'And are we all affected', '(See Chart 9)', 'Not all economic areas are running large net current account positions: the US deficit is mirrored, and is made possible, by growing surpluses in East Asia and in oil-exporting countries', 'In the euro area the current account has remained close to balance', 'Though not all economic areas contribute equally to the external imbalances, all are affected nonetheless', 'The extent to which we are all affected depends on the sustainability of this constellation of international savings and investment', 'Despite some dissenting voices, the broad consensus view is that this constellation is not sustainable over the longer run', 'Some economists have suggested that official financial accounts may underestimate the value of US external assets by not accounting for know-how, research and development and brand values', 'If a higher value were attributed to US foreign assets, this could allow the US to run higher sustainable current account deficits', 'The underlying calculations hinge on many assumptions, but the fundamental observation is that US net investment income has remained positive despite the accumulation of net external debt in excess of 25% of GDP', 'Recent data releases, however, indicate that US net investment income has turned negative', 'If the current constellation of international current account positions is ultimately unsustainable, an international macroeconomic adjustment is required which will have a global impact', 'One view with regard to the reabsorption of current account imbalances focuses on the role of real exchange rate adjustment via inflation differentials, nominal exchange rate changes, or both', 'There is evidence, however, that the scope for orderly adjustment through the exchange rate channel is limited: the responses of current account balances to exchange rate changes has been subdued in recent years, possibly because of structural changes', 'One reason for this is that the sensitivity of imports to exports has increased as a consequence of the structural international integration of production', 'Hence, a significant acceleration in the growth rate of exports relative to that of imports (which is necessary to reduce the trade deficit) seems unlikely to occur solely in response to exchange rate adjustment', 'Chart 10 shows the results of a recursive estimation of the long-run response of imports to changes in the components of GDP in the US, based on a simple dynamic equation: it indicates that, indeed, the elasticity of imports to exports has grown since the early 1990s', 'Current account sustainability depends also on variables that affect its financing', 'Foreign investors have evidently not lost their appetite for US dollar assets', 'Their preferences might also be influenced by factors other than return differentials on assets: for example, the special role of the US dollar as the main international reserve currency', 'The accumulation of large quantities of official reserves by many central banks in East Asia and in oil-exporting countries over the past three years can act as a balancing factor in the adjustment process', 'It has certainly increased interdependence via risk-sharing between the main international debtor and its creditors', 'Charts 11 and 12 show the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves in recent years by the major surplus countries and illustrate their evolution and distribution among countries over time', 'The issue of reserve accumulation has attracted much attention recently, both among academic economists and among market observers, in particular with regard to their diversification', 'Indeed, the emergence of the euro as an alternative reserve currency has created new opportunities for diversification', 'Charts 13 and 14 show that since the introduction of the euro, its share in the official foreign exchange reserves of industrial countries has increased slightly to 19', '2%, but its share in the official reserves of emerging market economies has risen significantly, from less than 19% in 1999 to more than 29% of total holdings in 2006\\xa0[1]', 'These developments have been the outcome of a completely market-driven process, prompted largely by the increasing credibility of the euro as a store of value, which is related, in our view, to the success of the stability-oriented single European monetary policy', 'From the ECB’s perspective, the international role of the euro is indeed, and should remain, a process driven by market forces', 'Multilateral strategy for addressing global imbalances and Europe’s contribution    Having diagnosed the causes of global imbalances, what is the remedy', 'What can – and should – be done in order to bring about an orderly adjustment', 'I have indicated, expressing the majority view, that the root of the global current account imbalances lies mostly in the international allocation of savings and investment', 'In other words: external imbalances are a reflection of internal imbalances', 'Does this mean that countries or economic areas which are broadly in external equilibrium, such as the euro area, have nothing to contribute to the adjustment of these imbalances', 'Some people would say: if you are not part of the solution, then you are part of the problem', 'Let me briefly discuss what we believe can be the euro area’s contribution to the adjustment of global imbalances', 'This view is consistent with the agreed G7 policy strategy aimed at achieving a turnaround in the path of global imbalances', 'The role we see for the euro area is to become a stronger and steady driving force for global growth, by establishing a fully operational internal market and encouraging innovation in production and business practices, as is also set out in the structural reform agenda that we refer to as the “Lisbon Strategy”', 'I see a wide scope for: structural reforms in labour and product markets to enhance efficiency, productivity and labour utilisation; for policies fostering Research & Development; and for measures to enhance international competitiveness', 'Such reforms will gradually raise both potential and actual growth', 'While they may not have an immediate large quantitative impact on external positions, we expect that they will contribute significantly over time and that they will have a greater effect if concentrated in the services sector', 'More generally, reforms that would increase the flexibility of the euro area economy would help support higher sustainable growth and enhance the economy’s resilience to external shocks', 'This is the “homework” that we have to do in the euro area, as reaffirmed in the most recent G7 Communiqué', 'And we are committed to facing up to these challenges so that the euro area can become a key contributor to a more balanced pattern of global growth', 'But I would like to emphasise again the paramount role of domestic policies in general in resolving global imbalances: I am referring to policies aimed at encouraging savings in the United States and policies that can boost domestic aggregate demand in surplus countries', 'In emerging markets in particular, I would like to point to the urgency of financial reforms that will decrease the precautionary motive for savings and assist the efficient channelling of savings in the domestic economies', 'Effective financial reforms will also support a smooth gradual move towards greater exchange rate flexibility for the currencies of emerging Asian countries with significant external surpluses and misaligned exchanged rates', 'For these countries, greater exchange rate flexibility would contribute to the adjustment of imbalances as part of the agreed policy strategy', 'The role and conduct of monetary policy     What are the implications of globalisation for monetary policy', 'Should its role and orientation be changed', 'Should the strategic framework for analysis and policy formulation be amended', 'Is the required analysis for setting policy becoming more demanding', 'The direct and brief answers to the last three questions are: no, no, and yes to some extent', 'Let me briefly elaborate and conclude', 'It is sometimes argued that in the globalised economy monetary policy should help guide the economy’s adjustment to the complex and fast-moving environment of new investment opportunities, evolving economic processes and competitive pressures associated with globalisation', 'It is also occasionally suggested that monetary policy should help foster the adjustment of global imbalances', 'Such arguments and suggestions for addressing problems of various kinds may seem to some attractive, but they have no merit because they would not provide solutions as their proponents claim', 'Globalisation does not affect the central role and overriding responsibility of central banks to preserve price stability', 'On the contrary, maintaining price stability in a rapidly evolving globalised economy that may influence the dynamics of inflation in various ways becomes more essential and challenging', 'The anchoring of inflation expectations to price stability in a country or economic area is also vital in a globalised economy in which adverse inflation shocks or inflationary pressures in some economies are now more easily transmitted to others and are more visible', 'And there is plenty of evidence to support our position that the delivery of price stability by a central bank, and its credible commitment to continue to do so in the future, fosters sustainable economic growth and minimises output volatility', 'If the role and primary objectives of monetary policy are not affected by globalisation and if the fundamental factors determining price level developments over the medium and long term are also unaffected, the appropriate strategic framework for analysis and policy formulation should remain the same', 'However, the analysis required for policy formulation will have to carefully take into account the various effects of globalisation on the dynamics of inflation and economic growth and of asset prices', 'For example: in a globalised economy the traditional measures of core inflation are more difficult to interpret and use as indicators of underlying domestic inflationary pressures; the estimates of potential output are more difficult to calculate in a robust manner; and the measurement and usefulness of output gaps are subject to greater uncertainty than is usually the case', 'So the bottom line is that our role and responsibilities as central bankers remain intact in the globalised economy, but the performance of our tasks may be becoming more challenging', 'Concluding remarks    For this reason, conferences like this one, bringing together academics and policy-makers from around the globe, are useful in developing common approaches to understand the fast-changing globalised world', 'In fact, I believe that a shared understanding of the common challenges we face and of the appropriate policy responses is emerging', 'However, as is often the case, it is action that lags behind', 'But I hope and expect that the strength of the analysis and the lessons from past experience will add impetus to the implementation of the necessary policies in a timely manner',

degree of independence of the central bank has fluctuated considerably', 'During major crises, the pendulum has tended to swing from one extreme to the other', '[1]  In the heyday of the gold standard, i', 'e', 'the decades preceding World War I, there was a commonly accepted understanding of how to preserve monetary and financial stability', 'The gold standard provided what we call a “nominal anchor”', 'It effectively ensured central bank independence from other public policies by subjecting monetary policy to an automatic rule', '[2] At the same time, there was a clear understanding of the role of central banks as a lender of last resort', 'Under that regime, central banks enjoyed sufficient discretion to take effective action in the event of banking panics', 'Adherence to the oft-quoted Bagehot principle (“lend freely at a high rate against good collateral” to solvent, but illiquid institutions[3]) ensured that lender of last resort activities did not threaten monetary stability', 'The pendulum began to swing away from this pre-war consensus when World War I prompted many countries to subordinate monetary policy to financing war and to suspend the gold standard', 'Countries returning to the gold standard after World War I, however, turned to overly rigid management of monetary affairs', 'Lacking the necessary discretion, following the Wall Street crash and the global recession in 1929, and the subsequent banking crisis, monetary policy prompted a precipitous collapse in money and prices', '[4] This spawned the greatest loss in jobs and output on record in what came to be remembered as the Great Depression', 'In a fateful irony of monetary history, the role of monetary policy in precipitating these calamitous events did not usher in monetary reform', 'On the contrary, notions hardened that monetary policy was powerless and that macroeconomic stability needed to be safeguarded through other policies', '[5] This shift in emphasis culminated in fiscal dominance, which contributed to the monetary mismanagement of the 1960s and 70s, paving the way for the “Great Inflation”', 'Only a few countries that preserved central bank independence, such as Germany, were able to maintain low inflation rates throughout these years', 'The Great Inflation was eventually overcome as monetary policy once again gained centre stage and was recognised as a powerful factor in macroeconomic stability', 'Economists, irrespective of their scholarly persuasion, and policymakers alike became convinced of Milton Friedman’s famous dictum that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”', '[6] This return to old wisdom helped to rebuild a consensus that central banks need to be granted sufficient independence to pursue monetary stability without political interference', 'The pendulum had swung back, and central bank independence became the mainstay of inflation targeting frameworks', 'In the European Union, the independence granted to the ECB for the pursuit of price stability is a central plank of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and has thereby attained a unique institutional and legal status', 'Challenges for central bank communication and accountability in times of crisis  We have been going through the biggest financial crisis in two generations, which has now lasted nearly a decade', 'Prior to it, monetary policy operated predominantly through adjustments to short-term interest rates', 'But the crisis has upended traditional patterns in finance and economics, and monetary policy is no exception', 'In its response to the crisis, the ECB has deployed a novel and complex range of instruments', 'The novelty and complexity of these unconventional measures have created challenges for accountability and transparency', 'The financial crisis has evolved in three main phases, each of which has required different monetary policy responses and has brought about particular challenges for central bank communication and accountability', 'The first phase was the abrupt liquidity crisis triggered by the turning of the global financial cycle and the subsequent collapse of Lehman Brothers', 'It provoked a systemic failure of funding markets and prompted global central banks to step in with forceful and coordinated interventions to provide essential liquidity to the banking sector', 'Without this response, the financial system would have collapsed and a far deeper recession would have ensued', 'Owing to the funding freeze, the classical interest rate instrument ceased to be the main signalling device of the monetary policy stance', 'The deployment of the central bank balance sheet as a stabilising instrument was a novelty, and immediately met substantial scepticism', 'First, there were concerns about moral hazard, given the unprecedented expansion of ECB credit to banks at a time when banks were under scrutiny for their mismanagement of risk in the pre-crisis period and for having precipitated the crisis in the first place', 'Second, there were also concerns about these liquidity injections paving the way for inflation', 'Owing to the incompleteness of the institutional structure of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the profound effects of the banking crisis were not addressed as swiftly in the euro area as in other jurisdictions', 'This paved the way for the second phase of the crisis, the sovereign debt crisis, which was amplified by the fact that banks predominantly hold debt securities of their own national governments', 'As the cost of borrowing increased for certain governments, banks with exposures to this debt came under intense market pressure, ultimately leading to entire national banking systems losing market access', 'This in turn resulted in financial fragmentation and a serious disruption of the monetary policy transmission mechanism', 'As a consequence, cuts in key ECB interest rates were not being passed on to firms and households to the same extent in every euro area country', 'To arrest and reverse this development, two policies were introduced', 'First, to ensure banks could rely on longer-term funding, central bank liquidity was made available for up to three years, and the collateral that could be used to access central bank money was expanded', 'Second, the announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) in 2012 removed the euro area break-up risk that was being priced into government borrowing costs', 'Notwithstanding the success of OMTs in alleviating redenomination risk, the sovereign debt crisis set back the recovery and laid the ground for the third phase of the crisis', 'Banks in large parts of the euro area became less willing and less capable of keeping credit flowing to the real economy, producing a vicious circle of contracting credit growth and weak demand dynamics', 'Accordingly, headline inflation began to drift downwards, owing both to global energy and commodity price developments and to ongoing weakness in the core components', 'In June 2014 monetary policy in the euro area embarked on a phase of renewed expansion, aimed both at enhancing monetary policy transmission, in a context of continued bank deleveraging, and increasing policy accommodation in view of persistently weak inflation', 'Having limited room for manoeuvre on the main refinancing rate, the ECB initiated a series of new unconventional measures', 'These consisted of our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), our asset purchase programme for public and private sector securities (APP), and our policy of charging a zero interest rate on main refinancing operations and a negative rate on excess reserves', 'As the floor of our monetary policy corridor – which by then had become the key instrument steering monetary conditions in the money market – was reduced to negative levels, other short to medium-term market yields dipped below the zero line as well', 'Given the novelty, scope and size of the measures taken, and given their potential interaction with other public policies, communication of these measures proved to be much more difficult than before the crisis, when we only had to explain how changes in the main policy interest rates affect the economy and ultimately the price level', 'Likewise, holding the ECB accountable for its monetary policy has also become more difficult', 'Let me illustrate this difficulty by considering how observers have been using Taylor rules to compare our policy interest rates with rule-based benchmarks', 'In a Taylor rule, such benchmarks are pinned down mainly by the deviation of inflation from target and by a measure of economic slack', 'On this basis, observers held central banks accountable for monetary policy decisions, as the relation between policy objective and instrument is transparent and not equivocal', 'In a nutshell, empirical regularities lay the ground for a prescriptive monetary policy rule – even though oversimplified – against which central bank actions can be evaluated', 'In crisis times, it turned out to be nearly impossible to track the monetary policy stance using a Taylor rule', 'First, with the interest rate having ceased to be the main instrument, incorporating balance sheet measures into the rule is not straightforward at all', 'Second, as the transmission of policy interest rates to the economy has been impaired, their comparison with Taylor rule benchmarks has become much less informative', 'Third, in view of persistently weak and low inflation and a high degree of economic slack, Taylor rules might well prescribe the setting of interest rates below their effective lower bound, wrongly indicating a tight policy stance, as the easing effects of unconventional measures cannot be accounted for', 'Developing other comparatively simple monitoring tools has not been possible', 'Overall, the ability of observers to use policy rules to hold the ECB accountable has been severely hindered', 'How can we then be sure that the measures taken fall within the ECB’s narrowly defined price stability mandate', 'The precise scope of our price stability mandate has been the subject of some debate in recent times', '[7] Some have argued that central banks, by engaging in a systematic expansion of their balance sheets, are in effect venturing into the realm of fiscal policy', 'Such views could be paving the way for another turnaround in the public perception and institutional status of central banks, which could result in less financial and, ultimately, less statutory independence', 'This threat may be even more pronounced in a world in which, virtually everywhere, public debt has surged to high levels, making political pressure on central banks to alleviate debt servicing costs through higher inflation more likely', '[8] Another swing of the pendulum', 'Central banks are ultimately judged on their success or failure in ensuring low and stable inflation', 'Central bank independence gives them the freedom to pursue their mandate', 'Independence does not mean that they can act in a completely unfettered way', 'In modern democratic societies, independent institutions are accountable', 'They need to explain the reasons for their actions and why these are appropriate for fulfilling the mandate that has been assigned to them as the result of a democratic process', 'For central banks, one of the challenges is to communicate their internal deliberations in a transparent manner to their external stakeholders', 'Safeguarding accountability The Treaty sets out an accountability framework for the ECB, which requires regular appearances by ECB officials before the European Parliament and the publishing of the Annual Report', 'Let me remind you that the ECB was the first major central bank to hold press conferences on its monetary policy decisions', 'The Economic Bulletin provides a comprehensive account of the economic and monetary analyses supporting the Governing Council’s assessments', 'In 2015, we took another important step: we started publishing accounts of the monetary policy meetings of the Governing Council, as an additional means to explain the deliberation process that leads to our actions', 'Overall, the steps that the ECB took to enhance transparency have been acknowledged in a report released this week by Transparency International EU', '[9] Concerning monetary policy communication, it notably commends our decision to publish regular accounts of the Governing Council’s monetary policy discussions', 'By explaining the rationale behind our policy decisions, the accounts also show how the measures we take are aligned with our mandate of maintaining price stability', 'This is important, because some unconventional monetary policy measures have been challenged on the grounds that they could be serving other policy objectives', 'To elaborate further on this, I will take a few examples of monetary policy measures that some have perceived to be fiscal or quasi-fiscal measures', 'It is imperative to be fully transparent on such measures and dispel any doubts about their motivation and their effect on price stability', 'Safeguards against encroachment on the area of fiscal responsibilities are extremely important', 'Conflicts with the price stability objective could emerge from monetary operations that support unsustainable government finances or insolvent financial institutions', 'There is no doubt that monetary policy has had beneficial effects on government finances; monetary policy has unavoidable implications for public budgets', 'The same kind of indirect support occurred during the easing cycle in the early 2000s, when our main refinancing rate was reduced to 2% – a very low level at the time – and was maintained at that level for more than two years', 'The fiscal ramifications of monetary policy that we see today (and in the early 2000s), however, differ fundamentally from the deliberately coordinated strategy of monetary financing that we observed in some countries in the 1970s', 'Today the use of any central bank instrument has to be justified solely on the basis of the central bank’s narrow price stability objective, and not on any fiscal consequences thereof', 'Borrowing from the theory of monetary regimes, it is the dominance of the central bank mandate over the objective governing fiscal conduct that differentiates the setting of monetary policy today from anything we saw prior to monetary union', 'The ECB continues to have the necessary institutional independence, the financial resources and operational capacity to take all appropriate measures, if and when needed, to counter upside or downside risks to price stability in a truly symmetric fashion', 'It could be argued that there are multiple channels through which the central bank could take on tasks and obligations that pertain to the fiscal authority, and some of these channels are both more subtle and less apparent than outright financing of public deficits', 'Extending liquidity support to insolvent banks is a case in point', 'But, even in this admittedly fuzzier terrain that separates liquidity provision from solvency support, the ECB operates in a sound framework that has passed multiple resilience tests in recent years', 'In the case of Greece, for instance, the choices of the Governing Council were another example of strict adherence to this framework', 'In keeping with Article 123 of the Treaty, which prohibits the ECB from monetary financing, the Governing Council imposed strict limits on the use of government securities as collateral for loans that the Greek banks received from the ECB', 'We nevertheless continued to supply the necessary liquidity so as to ensure the functioning of the Greek banking system and the continuation of lending to businesses and households', 'This was in line with the principle by which the Eurosystem may lend to banks which are solvent and have sufficient collateral', 'To sum up, the balance we achieved with our interventions during the Greek crisis was fully within our mandate; it respected the political commitment to the single currency contained in the Treaty, but at the same time we implemented that commitment within the limits of our Statute', 'The Treaty prohibition of monetary financing has been a key element in preserving the monetary policy nature of OMTs and the public sector purchase programme (PSPP)', 'The technical features of OMTs imply that they would only be considered if warranted from a monetary policy perspective', 'Moreover, the extra exposure to any single country that the Eurosystem might acquire as a consequence of OMT activation would be secured by the country’s strict obligations arising from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) macroeconomic adjustment programme to which the country would have to submit as a precondition', 'It is worth noting that in June 2015 the European Court of Justice ruled that, given the strict modalities for activation, OMTs fall within the scope of the ECB’s mandate and include sufficient safeguards to avoid monetary financing', 'A number of safeguards apply to public sector bond purchases under the PSPP too', 'Such purchases have a monetary policy purpose which is different from the one that applies to OMTs and are specifically aimed at bringing inflation back to our medium-term objective in a situation in which our key interest rates are at levels that can hardly be reduced much further', 'The modalities are exclusively governed by the primary objective of price stability and are decided in full independence, irrespective of developments in other policy areas', 'The size and duration of the PSPP are calculated to achieve progress towards the ECB’s inflation objective', 'The effectiveness of the tool is rooted in two important features of the financial system', 'First, government bond yields are the benchmark indicator for pricing a large set of private debt instruments', 'Second, government bond markets are deep and liquid', 'Interventions in these markets can initiate a process of portfolio rebalancing with significant secondary effects on broad financing conditions', 'Several safeguards are in place to minimise potential distortive effects on market functioning and price formation (such as the issuer limit and the issue share limit of 33%)', 'There has been a prominent financial stability dimension in all unconventional measures taken, but the existing institutional framework ensures that monetary policy is the last line of defence with respect to preserving financial stability', 'The establishment of the European banking union, in particular the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), has taken monetary policy one step further away from financial stability issues', 'Progress has been made to ensure that regulatory capture and forbearance are minimised and that shareholders bear responsibility and face the consequences of failure', 'But we are not there yet', 'These mechanisms need to be complemented by a common system of deposit protection, which would further bolster financial stability by reducing the risk of bank runs in crisis times', 'Conclusion To conclude, unconventional policies have been complicated to implement and to communicate', 'But they have been effective in enhancing our ability to deliver on our mandate in a medium-term perspective', 'Our measures have been designed to complement each other and have proved adaptable to and effective against the series of shocks which have buffeted the euro area economy', 'The complex nature of unconventional measures has repercussions for the transparency and accountability dimension of central bank independence', 'But they were a sine qua non for our mandate to be respected', 'The challenge from the monetary policy consequences of the financial crisis has placed a particularly heavy responsibility on the ECB to explain how the measures taken fall within the ambit of its price stability mandate', 'Non-standard measures have been designed in such a way that they cannot compensate for failures in other policy areas', 'The evolving institutional structure of EMU is further contributing to ensuring that, if at any critical juncture in future the macroeconomy faces risks, monetary policy will be able to concentrate solely on preserving price stability', '[1]I would like to thank Claus Brand for his contribution to this speech', '[2]As described in Barry Eichengreen (1992), Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919-1939, Oxford University Press, pp', '29-66, the credibility

willing to support sterling’s stability', 'The United States, at the time an agricultural exporter and a foreign borrower, with the Federal Reserve System not yet operating, faced more binding

      " list(['Monetary policy under inflation targeting   Contribution presented by Eugenio Domingo Solans, Member of the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Fourth Annual Conference of Banco Central de Chile, Santiago de Chile, 1 December 2000', 'It is a real pleasure to be in Santiago de Chile, even if it is to discuss inflation targeting', 'Thank you for inviting me to participate in this really important Fourth Annual Conference of Banco Central de Chile', 'I would also like to congratulate Banco Central de Chile on the occasion of its 75th anniversary', 'Allow me to put forward some ideas, which I am prepared to discuss with you during the questions and answers to this session', 'First of all, I think that there is an excessive and useless gap between academic discussions and central banking practice concerning monetary policy strategy', 'When reading academic literature, one draws the conclusion that many different and even opposite approaches exist, whereas - in practice - the ways in which central banks take monetary policy decisions are not so different', 'All steps taken to bridge this gap between theory and practice should be welcome', 'Never before have central banks been more closely aligned than nowadays in the strategies they actually apply, irrespective of whether these strategies have been made explicit or not and irrespective of whether or not the central banks comply with the strategies which they have formally made explicit', 'In other words, there is a tendency towards \"strategy standardisation\" in practical terms', 'Even the exchange rate monetary policy strategy, formally so different from the internal strategies, is in line with the idea of \"strategy standardisation\" since it is intended to \"import\" the outcome of a foreign monetary policy strategy by pegging the exchange rate to that of another currency', '\"Strategy standardisation\" can be explained as the outcome of the growing interaction between monetary policies and arrangements in different economic areas which is, in turn, related to the trend towards economic globalisation', 'In other words, \"strategy standardisation\" mirrors \"environment standardisation\"', 'Terminology should be useful, as should any convention', 'When terminology happens to be more confusing than illuminating, it is advisable to shift the attention from terms to substance, to pay attention to the real meaning of what we do and not to how we call what we do', 'A sign that indicates that something is starting to go wrong with terminology is when names need additional adjectives to be meaningful and when these additional adjectives become more and more relevant, e', 'g', 'pure inflation targeting, flexible inflation targeting, full-fledged inflation targeting, forward-looking inflation targeting, etc', 'Concerning flexible inflation targeting, I have nothing against flexibility except that if we are flexible enough when interpreting our strategies, we can reach a curious point where we can be doing more of less the same with different terms, in line with the idea of \"strategy standardisation\" that I mentioned earlier', 'I have nothing against full-fledged inflation targeting either, except that being full-fledged implies the existence of a diverse set of general conditions, most of which are institutional arrangements which are not specific to inflation targeting, but can be applied to any strategy', 'If we agree that our environment is marked by a high degree of complexity and if we accept that \"strategies should mirror environments\", we would also probably agree that monetary policy strategies cannot be simple, but need to be rather sophisticated so as to take into account the complexity of the environment', 'This can only be achieved by an all-encompassing strategy, i', 'e', 'a comprehensive and detailed strategy', 'If we accept that our environment is characterised by the existence of uncertainty (i', 'e', 'changing and unpredictable conditions), we would probably also accept that monetary policy strategies should be flexible enough to be able to give the appropriate response to changing and unpredictable conditions', 'Therefore, given the existing degree of complexity and uncertainty which characterises the economic environment, any appropriate monetary policy strategy should be all-encompassing and flexible', 'A strategy should be all-encompassing in the sense that it should consider in a comprehensive and detailed way all possible relationships between variables that are of some relevance for monetary policy purposes, in accordance with present knowledge, taking into account more than one single paradigm', 'Being all-encompassing excludes shortcuts and quick and simple solutions', 'Being all-encompassing excludes paying attention only to the first and to the last steps of the complex chain which links the monetary policy objective with the instrument variable', 'The strategy should also be flexible in the sense that it should be readily adaptable to changing and unpredictable conditions', 'This excludes any kind of mechanical approach, since mechanicism implies routine and automatism, which are unable to deal with unpredictable changes', 'Does the inflation targeting strategy comply with the requirement of being all-encompassing and flexible (i', 'e', 'comprehensive, detailed and adaptable to change and to non-predictable conditions)', 'My answer is \"no\", unless we \"bend\" the meaning of the label \"flexible inflation targeting\" to a point at which it can accommodate almost any practice', 'If this were the case, even the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, with the flexibility inherent in its two pillars, could be considered a flexible inflation targeting strategy', 'Of course, this is not the case, as I will try to explain', 'The question then is how far one can \"bend\" the concept of inflation targeting by introducing flexibility without making it lose its meaning', 'In this respect, no matter how much one \"bends\" the concept of flexible inflation targeting, it will still have to keep some characteristics to \"deserve\" that name', 'These minimum features, characteristics or conditions are, in my opinion, at least the following:      A well-specified objective of inflation should be pre-established', 'Well specified implies an exact definition of the inflation index and the existence of a quantitative target with either a point target or a narrow enough range in order to be significant', 'Well-specified also means that the time horizon of the target should be consistent with the monetary policy lags', 'It should give a prominent role to inflation forecasts published by central banks, which constitute the basis for decision', 'These published forecasts are to be consistent in definition and timing with the specified objective of inflation', 'All available information concerning the outlook for price developments should boil down to an inflation forecast which should act as some sort of intermediate target of monetary policy', 'A well-specified monetary policy reaction function should exist and policy-makers should be committed to take decisions following the inflation forecast by comparing it with the established inflation objective, irrespective of other elements which underlie inflation risks', 'The monetary policy reaction function should work symmetrically, reacting not only when the target is overshot, but also when it is undershot', 'This symmetric approach has sound doctrinal implications regarding the acceptance of a trade-off between output growth and stability', 'Pre-established, well-defined, built-in, formal \"escape clauses\" can be introduced provided that they are exceptional and with limited discretion', 'Inflation targeting should be seen as a monetary policy rule, a more or less simple rule, a more or less pure rule, but nevertheless a rule', 'This means that applying an inflation targeting strategy implies a meaningful degree of automatism and a limited degree of discretion and judgement, as with any other rule', 'It goes without saying that judgement exists in a rule-based strategy, not so much when applying the rule, but rather when designing it, as a sort of built-in judgement', 'Let me compare first these features of the inflation targeting strategy with the strategy applied by the European Central Bank (ECB)', 'As you know, the ECB has a quantitative definition of price stability (any increase of the HICP below 2% for the whole euro area to be complied within a medium term perspective) and its monetary policy strategy is based on two pillars: the first gives a prominent role to money, basically signalling a reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate, namely M3, and the second pillar consists of a broadly based assessment of the outlook for future price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole', \"None of the inflation targeting characteristics described before can be applied to the ECB's monetary policy strategy\", 'A quantitative definition of stability is not an inflation target in conceptual and practical terms', 'It is rather a specification of the objective established in the Maastricht Treaty', 'In theory and in practice there could exist a central bank operating in a highly inflationary environment with both a definition of stability and an inflation targeting operating in a gradual disinflation process', 'The ECB is, certainly, obliged to comply with its objective in a medium term perspective, but its monetary policy decisions do not \"target\" it, in the sense that the ECB will not react mechanically if the HICP increase goes beyond the limit of the definition', 'Furthermore, the idea of symmetry when targeting the objective, which characterises inflation targeting, does not apply in any way to the definition of stability of the ECB', 'Avoiding deflation as well as inflation cannot be compared with the symmetric approach of inflation targeting, which implies not accepting inflation levels below the target as a policy decision to foster economic growth', \"The ECB's strategy has no inflation forecast which is a main and basic element of the inflation targeting approach\", 'Certainly, the ECB has a staff macroeconomic projection, including inflation projections among other variables, to be published shortly in the December edition of the Monthly Bulletin', 'Nevertheless, these macroeconomic projections are far from playing a comparable role to that of inflation forecasts in the inflation targeting strategy', 'Macroeconomic projections by ECB staff are only one element among others (including other external projections and forecasts) in the second pillar of the strategy and it would be unthinkable that these projections could by themselves trigger an automatic monetary policy response without additional evidence', 'Again, projections are useful, but they are not the only element of this second pillar, not to say of the whole strategy', 'Understanding the limited role of macroeconomic projections by ECB staff in the decision-making process is crucial to avoid confusing and misleading interpretations of the decisions', 'Not being aware of the limitations of the use of published projections made by ECB staff in the decision-making process would paradoxically decrease the degree of transparency instead of increasing it, which should be its main purpose', \"To conclude this part: the ECB's monetary policy strategy could only be identified with inflation targeting if we interpreted the above-mentioned conditions of an inflation targeting strategy in a too flexible way\", 'In the other extreme, if the sole existence of a general commitment to price stability would be enough to label a central bank as an inflation targeter, then the question should be which central bank in the world does not follow an inflation targeting strategy', 'Let me now explain why, in my opinion, a strategy based on the characteristics of inflation targeting as described before would not be the most appropriate in as complex and uncertain an environment as the current one', 'First of all, central banks should resist the temptation to think that their models and their forecasts are so good that they do not to require additional support', 'Central banks must, of course, have their own models and their own forecasts, but - in order to take sensible decisions - it seems wise and prudent not to base them only on this element', 'Secondly, there is no economic model robust enough to encompass all the relevant external information needed to take sensible monetary policy decisions', 'Therefore, it is impossible to boil down to a single forecast all the relevant information necessary to assess the outlook for future price developments', 'Moreover, this relevant information could be constantly changing, in unpredictable ways in quantitative and qualitative terms', 'If there were a model and a forecast able to grasp all the relevant information at a certain moment, this model would need constant revision and reassessment to accommodate changes, which would, in turn, demand a high degree of discretion and judgement', 'The advantages of a rule in terms of simplicity, automatism, predictability, etc', 'disappear as soon as we are obliged to constantly change the contents of this rule', 'How can the central bank be sure that its forecast is safe enough', 'Why not complement it with the information obtained from forecasts developed by other institutions', 'Why not rely on other sources of information and embody them into the strategy', 'Why should central banks be committed to take decisions on less safe grounds when it is possible to improve the information', 'What are we looking for: right decisions, or less safe decisions but yet consistent with a published forecast and therefore transparent and predictable', 'Moreover, even assuming that the projections or forecasts are good enough, even perfect, the forecast inflation figure does not convey enough information to take a sound enough monetary policy decision', 'Should monetary policy have the same reaction if the forecast inflation is the result of an internal factor or an external one', 'Should monetary policy not distinguish between permanent and transitory factors affecting inflation', 'Should the monetary policy reaction be the same if one single forecast inflation figure is the result of a supply side shock rather than excess demand', 'The obvious answer to all these questions is \"of course not\": the monetary response to a given inflation forecast depends on the factors which underlie the forecast', 'All these arguments lead to a clear conclusion: provided that we do not \"bend\" the flexibility beyond the point where it would lose its real meaning, inflation targeting implies a degree of simplicity, automatism, mechanicism and precommitment which makes it unsuitable to tackle a high degree of complexity and uncertainty as the one prevailing in today\\'s world and especially in the euro area after the huge structural break produced by the introduction of the euro', 'Tackling the current degree of complexity and uncertainty demands a more comprehensive, detailed, flexible and discretionary strategy', 'Of course, I am prepared to accept the possible advantages of inflation targeting in terms of simplicity, precommitment, predictability, transparency and accountability', 'Certainly, all these factors are important, but this does not necessarily mean that a monetary policy strategy is obliged to comply with these requirements to an extent which could endanger effectiveness', 'There are alternative institutional ways of being transparent and accountable without sacrificing the effectiveness of the strategy', 'Politicians want central banks to be transparent and accountable', 'Market players want central banks to be transparent and fully predictable', 'But both politicians and market players are not fully aware of the complexities of monetary policy making', 'Our obligation as central bankers is to make them understand that what is even more important than transparency, accountability and predictability is honesty and that, honestly speaking, a monetary policy strategy should be above all effective', 'Inflation targeting is not the most effective strategy under the present circumstances, unless we interpret this label in such a flexible way that it can almost accommodate any practice', 'I am really sorry for being a \"killjoy\" at a conference celebrating ten years of inflation targeting in Chile and in the world by reminding you that the central bank\\'s world is not Panglossian'])\n",
      " list(['Introduction [1]  First of all, I would like to thank the Società Italiana di Pediatria for inviting me to participate in its Annual Meeting', 'You are probably wondering what an economist is doing at a paediatricians’ meeting', 'To tell you the truth, I have been wondering about that too', 'Let me try to answer that question', 'In brief, this will be my line of argument, based on nine points', 'In a society characterised by limited demographic growth, technological progress is the main engine of economic growth', 'The main instrument for developing technology is human capital', 'The supply of skilled labour, which makes intensive use of human capital, is not keeping pace with the increase in demand, either in the United States or in Europe', 'This explains why there is a strong correlation between the level of education and the probability of getting a well-paid job', 'Those who do not have access to education risk being marginalised and having a relatively low income', 'Over the past 25 years, the supply of education has not increased in line with demand, and this has generated a worldwide “excess demand” for high-level education, increasing competition and costs', 'In other words, when it comes to gaining access to high-quality education, competition is now much fiercer than it was for the previous generation', 'In advanced societies, the new generations are not prepared for the new competitive environment', 'Such preparation occurs during the early years of an individual’s life (according to some, during the first seven years), when the personality and the cognitive abilities are shaped', 'Educational methods are largely responsible for this lag', 'The natural tendency to apply the methods inherited from the previous generation is insufficient in the context of excess demand for high-quality education', 'It is not easy to change educational methods, in respect of those we experienced ourselves, and to adapt them to the needs of a global society', 'It requires critical capacity and the ability to listen, powers which not many people have', 'But there is one important exception, to which I will return at the end of my remarks', 'I would like to develop each of these points in turn', 'Main drivers of growth: theory According to economic theory, growth is driven by developments in labour and capital and by developments in their productivity', 'Demographic trends affect economic growth via the effects related to the size and the structure of the population, i', 'e', 'mainly via changes in the number of persons of working age (usually assumed to be between the ages of 15 and 64)', 'In turn, technological progress affects growth via the impact on labour and capital productivity', 'From a more analytical perspective, per capita income can be broken down into labour productivity (per person employed), demographic factors (i', 'e', 'the size of the working age population relative to the overall population) and the employment rate (Chart 1)', 'If we compare some advanced economies, namely the euro area, the United States and the United Kingdom, and three emerging market economies, i', 'e', 'Brazil, China and India, three main messages emerge', 'First, productivity gains are the prime engine of economic growth', 'Second, productivity growth significantly slowed in the euro area after the mid-1990s, while it accelerated elsewhere (except in the United Kingdom), particularly in emerging economies', 'Third, demographic developments made a sizeable contribution to growth in the emerging market economies, while this contribution was much smaller or even negative in advanced economies', 'In essence, these data show that fostering innovation is key, especially for those economies characterised by a shrinking share of working age population owing to ageing', 'This leads me to a brief analysis of some stylised facts on demographic developments in advanced and emerging market economies', 'I will then talk about technological progress', 'Finally, I will discuss the importance of human capital accumulation and of education in particular', 'Some stylised facts on demographic developments… If we look at demographic developments in advanced economies such as Italy, the euro area (as an average), the United Kingdom and the United States and compare them with those in selected emerging market economies such as Brazil, China and India, three significant differences emerge', 'First, emerging market economies tend to have more young people (Chart 2)', 'In India almost one in three people were aged 14 or younger in 2008, while in Italy – which is among the countries with the lowest share of young people – the corresponding figure was only one in seven (14', '2% of the overall population)', 'The slide also shows that the share of people aged 14 or younger has been declining in all these advanced and emerging market economies since 1985', 'However, although this decline has been even stronger in the emerging market economies, these countries still have proportionately more young people', 'Second, the share of the working age population in advanced economies has remained either broadly stable or has declined over the past 25 years, while it has risen substantially in emerging market economies (Chart 3)', 'In Brazil, for example, the share of the working age population rose by more than 8 percentage points between 1985 and 2008, while it declined by almost 1', '7 percentage points in Italy', 'Third, the populations of many industrialised countries have been ageing, while those of Brazil, China and India have been getting younger', 'These diverse demographic developments – and the ageing of the population in particular – make it more difficult for many advanced economies to continue to grow and to remain competitive on world markets', 'The problem has been exacerbated over the past 25 years, not least because many advanced economies have not acted quickly enough to address the ageing problem and its detrimental impact on economic growth', 'But competition from emerging market economies has not waited', 'Moreover, in many of these emerging economies, competitiveness has also been stimulated by investment in the technology sector', 'Let me elaborate on this last point with the help of a few figures', '…and on technological progress Ten years ago the EU Member States committed to transforming the EU by 2010 into “the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world […]”, as emphasised in the Lisbon strategy', 'In order to achieve this aim, an explicit target was introduced whereby each country was to spend at least 3% of GDP on research and development (R&D) by the year 2010', 'The data clearly show that progress in this direction has in fact been very limited (Chart\\xa04)', 'Among the largest four euro area countries, Italy ranks the lowest, and its level of R&D intensity has increased marginally since 1996', '[2] At the other end of the spectrum, China more than doubled its investment in R&D over the same period', 'The role of human capital Together with R&D, the economy’s ability to innovate crucially depends on human capital', '[3]  Human capital is a broad concept, covering a set of skills which are acquired through education, as well as via on-the-job training and experience', 'Also, human capital is affected by health conditions, on which people’s cognitive abilities directly depend', 'The importance of human capital to economic growth has been demonstrated in a number of empirical analyses', '[4] Several studies show that more affluent economies are also richer in human capital', 'For example, there is a clear positive relationship between the average years of schooling and per capita income in advanced economies (Chart\\xa05)', 'In addition, a vast literature in the field of labour economics has provided evidence that a positive causal relationship – which is significant and robust – can be found between the years of formal schooling (at primary, secondary and tertiary level) and wages', 'This evidence suggests that private, or so-called “Mincerian” [5], returns on education are within an average range of 6', '5% to 9%; this means that an additional year of formal schooling is associated with a 7', '5% increase in wages on average over a working life', '[6] Chart 6 illustrates the evolution of the wage premium of college graduates and high school graduates in the United States', 'It shows that those who achieve higher educational levels enjoy substantially higher earnings; moreover, the wage gap between educated and less educated workers seems to have significantly widened since the early 1980s', 'The evidence related to the rise in returns on education – together with that on the inequality of earnings – provides useful information on the supply and demand of skills', 'In particular, these factors would suggest that while the relative demand for more educated workers has steadily increased in line with technological advances, the supply of highly skilled labour has not always kept pace with demand', 'In other words, the rise in the premium associated with technical skills indicates a mismatch between the insufficient supply of education and growing labour market requirements', 'This hypothesis – which has recently been put forward by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz in respect of the United States [7] – would in my view also apply to a number of European economies where high-quality education is in short supply', 'An analysis of educational wage differentials in selected EU countries reveals that Germany and Italy register the highest premium for those with tertiary education, indicating high excess demand for highly educated workers (Chart\\xa07)', 'Educational attainment in the United States and selected EU countries', 'Where do we stand', 'Chart 8 shows the percentage of the population which in 2008 had completed at least upper secondary education (left panel) and tertiary education (right panel)', 'Both panels show the educational level of the young generation (aged 25-34) versus older age groups (therefore those who were in the young cohort a generation earlier)', 'All countries have experienced an overall improvement in the skill levels of their population: on average 79% of euro area citizens aged between 25 and 34 have at least completed upper secondary education; this proportion is 26 percentage points higher than among those aged between 55 and 64', 'However, there are considerable disparities across countries', 'For instance, in Spain and Italy the percentage of young people with upper secondary education is still below the euro area average, and much lower than in Germany and France (which are now at levels close to the United States)', 'When looking at tertiary education, the performance of the Italian economy is significantly worse', 'In addition, the quality of education is at least as important as the number of years of formal schooling', 'This is usually measured by a number of indicators, including pupil-to- teacher ratios, the educational level of teachers, and students’ performance in internationally standardised tests', 'Interestingly, a number of international studies suggest that, with regard to explaining the impact of education on growth, the quality of schooling is more important than the quantity', 'Put simply, it is not only the time spent at school that matters; it is what you learn, how you learn it, and from whom', 'More generally, recent research conducted by economists at the ECB suggests that improvements in the quality of labour have made a substantial positive contribution to labour productivity growth in the euro area', 'In particular, those who have achieved at least degree-level education are, on average, more productive than those who have only primary education', '[8]  Overall, despite the progress made, improving education – in both quantitative and qualitative terms – remains high on the policy agenda in Europe', 'In order to give you a sense of the relative importance assigned to education in advanced and emerging economies, Chart 9 illustrates the expenditure in education as a share of total government expenditure', 'Again, the Italian economy’s bottom ranking is striking – especially in comparison with emerging economies – and thereby calls for a more decisive effort in this area', 'Finally, let me add that today’s young people in advanced economies face much tougher competition than those three decades ago; in particular, competition for access to top international universities appears to have increased', 'The total number of students in science and engineering has been steadily increasing since the mid-1980s, and the rise has been most rapid over the past decade (Chart 10)', 'Looking at the breakdown between US and non-US citizens, we can see that in 1985 fewer than 30% of science and engineering students came from outside the United States, whereas in 2008 their share was close to 40% (Chart 11)', 'A breakdown of doctorate students in the United States by country of origin reveals that the share of Chinese and Indian students has increased at an extraordinary rate, from 9% in 1997 to almost 15% in 2007-08 (Chart 12)', 'Over the same period, the proportion of students from EU countries remained substantially below the proportion of Chinese and Indian students, and has changed only marginally, despite the increasing need in advanced economies for highly skilled labour', 'Concluding remarks In industrialised countries, the generation now entering the labour market is, for the first time since the Second World War, facing worse conditions, on average, than those faced by the previous generation', 'And there is a risk that the situation will be even worse for the subsequent generation', 'If there is not a rapid reversal of this trend, our societies may face huge economic and social problems', 'Reversing the trend will require decisive action at the level of both supply and demand of education', 'Public debate has largely focused on supply, which is certainly important and assigns responsibility for improving the quality of education to public authorities', 'But too little attention is paid to demand, which is insufficient owing to a lack of awareness of the fact that, without an adequate education, an individual’s standard of living not only will not improve, but will inevitably decline', 'Our societies are not sufficiently aware of the fact that those who are not adequately prepared to compete for a better education will be denied access', 'Acquiring human capital is not just essential, it is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive', 'We are thus faced with the problem of how to prepare the young people of today, and future generations, for the challenges that lie ahead', 'In order to resolve this problem, there must be a greater understanding of learning processes', 'Jean Piaget, the pioneer of the constructivist theory of knowledge, explained that learning progresses through the stages of sensory and motor skills and cognitive abilities, before resulting in an ability to assimilate formal instruction', 'A deficiency at any one stage can result in problems in the stages thereafter', 'Without the appropriately developed cognitive skills, even intensive academic instruction and hours of private tuition do not succeed in making up for the gap accumulated in the previous learning stages', 'A child’s first years are his or her most formative ones', 'From birth, children are filtering stimuli and learning how to interact with their surroundings and the people they are in contact with', 'Parents play a critical role in laying the foundations for their child’s education', 'They are most often a child’s first teachers: they pass on not only the fundamentals of education, but also teach the child how to learn', 'However, when educating their children, parents often rely on personal experience', 'But the simple transmission of knowledge from parents to children is no longer sufficient', 'Piaget wrote that “indeed, the aim of intellectual education is not to know how to repeat or to conserve ready-made truths', 'It is in learning to gain the truth by oneself at the risk of losing time and of going through all the roundabout ways that are inherent in real activity”', 'He continued: “Education, for most people, means trying to lead the child to resemble the typical adult of his society…but for me and no one else, education means making creators', 'You have to make inventors, innovators – not conformists”', '[9]    Parents must receive guidance on how to correctly adapt the education of their children to the new needs of society in the future', 'However, parents are often unwilling to accept outside interference', 'They will not be inclined to listen to anyone who tries to convince them that simply reproducing the systems and procedures that they themselves experienced – which, as I explained earlier, were probably sufficient in a world that differed from the one we are living in today, with an excess demand for high-quality education – is damaging for the cognitive growth of their children', 'There is, however, one exception to this', 'Personal experience tells me that if there is someone that parents are prepared to listen to, someone in whom they place absolute faith, it is the paediatrician', 'I don’t want to go into why this is, but it is a fact, a fact which you paediatricians have to take on board and which gives you considerable responsibility', 'On the other hand, the arguments that I have put forward up to now are well-known to you, as you will have experienced them yourselves during your education', 'The difficulty of gaining access to higher education, the growing competition and the correlation between education and quality of life are not new to you', 'Whether you like it or not, your role cannot be limited to the field of medicine because your actions have an impact on the development of economic systems', 'Through your scientific work and your practice, you contribute every day to extending life and thus to the ageing of the population', 'The problem is that our advanced societies are not yet well-equipped to deal with these developments', 'Those who pay the highest price may well be precisely those children that you help every day, who will not be adequately prepared to face the challenges that society has dropped on them', 'What, then, is the function of the paediatrician', 'My suggestion to you is to take advantage of the receptive ears that parents have for you, not only to give them the necessary medical advice, but also to help them to be parents in our modern society, a role which is much more important – and more difficult – than is often thought', 'I am sure that you are already doing so', 'Thank you very much for your attention', 'Charts             Chart 1: Average contribution to real per capita GDP growth

      " list(['An anchor of stability and confidence   Contribution by Jean-Claude Trichet,President of the European Central Bankto Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,26 March 2010 The public at large generally takes notice of central bank activities mostly when there are special circumstances', 'The financial crisis and the extraordinary measures taken by central banks across the globe in response to it are an example of such special circumstances', 'In normal periods, central bank actions in pursuit of price stability are less noticed', 'This holds all the more true when periods of inflation are long past and memories of the negative consequences of instable currencies have faded away', 'Since the introduction of the euro, the phenomena of price instability have not been something that citizens of the euro area have really needed to concern themselves with in their everyday lives', 'This is to the credit of the European Central Bank (ECB), its Governing Council and the “monetary team” including all national central banks belonging to the Eurosystem', 'The ECB has kept the promise of the euro’s founding fathers to keep the value of money stable', 'The average annual rate of inflation for the first 12 years of the euro up to the end of 2010 is expected to be about 1', '95%', 'This is exactly in line with our quantitative objective for price stability, which aims for medium-term growth in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area to be close to, but below, 2%', 'By comparison, the average rate of inflation in Germany in the 1990s, i', 'e', 'prior to the introduction of the euro, was 2', '2%, after 2', '9% in the 1980s and 4', '9% in the 1970s', 'In other words, the euro holds its own in the area of stability when compared with the Deutsche Mark', 'As promised, the euro is at least as strong as the most stable currencies that preceded it, especially it is “mindestens so stark wie die D-Mark”', 'I could even underline that the German national inflation rate with the euro has been significantly lower than the average in the euro area and, therefore, much lower than at the time of the D-Mark: 1', '5% per year, on average from 1999 to 2009', 'Given the significant challenges faced by the euro area over recent years, this is a great achievement – especially for a young central bank responsible for a new currency in a newly created single currency area comprising 16 countries and 330 million citizens', 'In addition, the ECB has been successful with its reliable policies in anchoring future inflation expectations in line with the definition of price stability', 'This is another of its achievements', 'Citizens and financial market agents consider the ECB’s stability target to be a credible one, and continued to do so even during the difficult conditions of the financial crisis', 'Fixing a quantitative definition of price stability was a key factor that contributed to the solid anchoring of inflation expectations', 'The definition was useful both in times of increased inflationary pressure – not least in the first half of 2008 when oil prices were high – and in times when risks of deflationary developments were being discussed by the markets – as occurred during the peak of the financial crisis in autumn 2008', 'The current financial crisis represents a break not experienced in the world economy since World War II', 'The challenges posed by the crisis are immense, and in many areas we are still at the beginning of implementing the unavoidable and necessary changes', 'It is now clear to all actors that, in a globalised world, mistakes at the individual level – for example, unsustainable business models of certain large banks – can very quickly amplify into developments at the aggregate level that lead to dangerous imbalances across the entire system', 'This holds all the more if there are already marked imbalances within the system at the outset, such as in the current accounts of important economies', 'It was thanks only to the extremely speedy, comprehensive and well-coordinated monetary and fiscal policy interventions that, in autumn 2008, panic on the markets was held at bay and that a widespread stabilisation was subsequently achieved', 'In Europe, in particular, the crisis management proved to be effective', 'This should not be forgotten when drawing all the necessary lessons from the crisis, not only globally, but also at the European level and within the individual Member States of the euro area', 'At the international level – within the G20 and supported, in particular, by the Financial Stability Board – there is agreement that the global financial system must be made much more resilient and less susceptible to risk', 'In the EU, cooperation between national supervisory authorities will be improved through the creation of a European system for financial supervision', 'In addition, a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) is being established, which will issue early warnings and recommendations in order to prevent risks from arising that threaten the financial system as a whole', 'The ECB will provide the Secretariat to the ESRB and give analytical and organisational support', 'The crisis is forcing us to undertake careful analysis to identify where mistakes were made, and to correct them, even in the face of resistance from the political domain', 'At the same time, however, we should also identify what has proved itself to be of worth and what should be maintained as is', 'At the macroeconomic level, as I have already said at another occasion, there is one conclusion that should certainly not be drawn from the financial crisis, namely that higher rates of inflation should be targeted in future', 'There are no discernible macroeconomic benefits that would compensate for the obvious costs of increased inflation – higher risk premia and higher long-term interest rates, to name just two', 'And we should never forget that low inflation preserves the purchasing power of our most vulnerable and poorer fellow citizens', 'The financial crisis has not brought about any change in this fundamental assessment: contrary to the fears of some critics, the non-conventional monetary policy measures taken by the ECB had exactly the desired effect, even in an environment of temporarily negative inflation rates, so that they can now – given the normalisation of the outlook for inflation and the prospect of a general market recovery – be phased-out, step by step', 'The ECB will uphold its definition of price stability', 'One characteristic of the ECB and the national central banks of the Eurosystem is that their activities are oriented towards the long term', 'In an environment generally characterised by short-term horizons, the ECB’s long-term approach differentiates it from what occurs in both general politics and the private financial sector', 'It is not surprising that political behaviour in democracies is strongly dependent on election cycles', 'In the field of fiscal policy in particular, this might encourage short-term action focused on election dates, resulting in a tendency to engage in deficit spending and growing government debt', 'As emphasised in the political economy literature, this short-term approach is, in fact, built into the political process itself, which demands that political actors are re-legitimised by means of elections at regular intervals', 'However, short-termism can and should be corrected through fiscal rules that work towards the sustainability of public finances', 'Examples of this include the Stability and Growth Pact and the recently agreed, and much to be welcomed, ‘debt brake’ built into German law', 'Activity in the private sector is often governed by the quest for short-term profits', 'Seeking profits is legitimate and an important motivation in a market economy, but an excessive gearing towards the short-term is problematic', 'Too strong a focus on the short term was one of the major errors made by the financial sector', 'It was intensified by, among other things, reward systems that created false incentives', 'The reforms currently being discussed are therefore rightly aimed at combating excessive short-termism in the financial sector, as well as other false incentives', 'Goethe’s statement to Eckermann in 1830 has again become particularly meaningful: “The most important issue is to learn self-restraint', 'If I wanted to let myself go without any restraint, I could well destroy myself and my environment', '” We have strongly admonished actors in the financial sector to exercise their responsibility to demonstrate self-restraint', 'Profits should not be used to pay disproportionate bonuses, but rather to strengthen balance sheets, in order to safeguard the supply of credit', 'The activities of the ECB and the national central banks of the Eurosystem are not subject to any election cycle', 'In fact, the opposite is true: the long-term focus of their activities is explicitly safeguarded by a wide-ranging institutional arrangement that ensures the full independence of the ECB and the national central banks of the Eurosystem from political and any other influence, at both the European and the national level', 'Central bank independence is the result of a long learning process as old as paper money itself', 'On account of particularly difficult experiences in its past, the Federal Republic of Germany was one of the very first European countries to have an independent central bank', 'I myself was the first governor of the fully independent French central bank more than sixteen years ago', 'The model of an independent central bank, which proved to be a successful one, was then “Europeanised” and became the norm for the ECB and the Eurosystem', 'Today, it is a well-documented viewpoint in economics that independent central banks are in a better position to guarantee low and stable inflation rates than central banks that are subject to political influence', 'Empirical evidence for this dates back, in particular, to the works of Cukierman (1992), and Alesina and Summers (1993)', 'Although this finding may not surprise many monetary policy-makers, it is, in fact, only through the modern analysis of the time inconsistency problem of monetary policy that it has been clearly underpinned in economic theory', 'Fundamental theoretical papers on this topic include those of Kydland and Prescott (1977) and of Barro and Gordon (1983)', 'These studies argue that, in the short term, there is the temptation for monetary policy to exploit a seemingly existing trade-off between employment and inflation through expansionary policy measures', 'In the long run, however, there is no such trade-off because, given the adjustment of inflation expectations, these measures would be systematically anticipated and would thus be rendered completely ineffective', 'The outcome would simply be higher inflation without any benefits to employment or growth', 'The ECB’s mandate and its independent status are laid down in the European treaties', 'These treaties were ratified by democratically elected parliaments in all Member States and, in some countries, by referenda', 'The core elements of the Monetary Union – namely price stability as the primary objective of monetary policy and an independent central bank – have remained unchanged in each of the treaty revisions since first laid down in the Maastricht Treaty in 1992', 'Accordingly, they were reconfirmed and re-legitimised through the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by now 27 EU Member States', 'The members of the ECB’s decision-making bodies are appointed by democratically elected politicians', 'In addition, provisions are in place in order to ensure the personal independence of individual monetary policy-makers', 'For example, the term of office for members of the Executive Board of the ECB is limited to eight years, and is non-renewable', 'Together, the treaty-enshrined foundations of the Monetary Union combine the ECB’s independence with clear, democratic legitimation', 'Price stability is in the acknowledged, very best long-term interests of the people', 'Stable prices benefit society as a whole, rather than serving individual interests', 'Price stability guarantees the purchasing power of income and the value of savings', 'It prevents arbitrary redistribution and fosters employment and growth', 'Only when prices are stable is the price mechanism – the key tool for managing supply and demand in a market economy – transparent and efficient', 'These findings also have a strong tradition within German economic science', 'Walter Eucken (1952), one of the spiritual fathers of what is known as “Ordnungspolitik” and the social market economy, rightly described price stability – as he put it at the time, the “primacy of foreign exchange policy” – as one of the constitutive principles of a competitive order', 'He envisioned a “monetary constitution with a stabiliser for monetary value” that would avoid both inflation and deflation, and would function “as automatically as possible”', 'The EU’s monetary constitution reflects a consensus on stability among economists that has developed in Europe over many decades', 'With its constitutionally guaranteed independence, the ECB acts as a stabiliser of the value of money', 'There is no completely automatic guarantee of a stable value of money, but the clear commitment to the primary objective of maintaining price stability acts as a compass in all decisions relating to European monetary policy', 'In democracies, certain tensions between independent central banks on the one hand and governments as well as economic and financial pressure groups on the other hand, do arise from time to time', 'Given agents’ varying time horizons, these tensions are part of the nature of the issue at hand', 'The Deutsche Bundesbank and its predecessor, the Bank deutscher Länder, were repeatedly subject to criticism', 'An early example thereof is the well-known speech by Adenauer in 1956, when he branded an increase in interest rates as a “guillotine for the man of the street”', 'The ECB itself cannot claim to have been lacking advice from the political sphere', 'It joins a long tradition of independent central banks in this respect', 'Several euro area governments criticised the ECB when it decided not to decrease interest rates in 2004 and to raise them at end of 2005', 'With the benefit of hindsight nobody would now question that the decisions of the time were appropriate', 'The exemplary nature of the cases cited is also revealed by the fact that criticism almost always arises in response to restrictive monetary policy measures', 'Expansionary measures, by contrast, are virtually never criticised', 'This, too, reflects the differences in the time horizons envisaged by independent central banks, on the one hand, and executive branches as well as pressure groups on the other', 'Looking ahead, the financial crisis has created considerable challenges for monetary and fiscal policy', 'From the very outset, the monetary policy measures taken by the Eurosystem during the financial crisis were specifically designed in such a way that they could be phased out relatively easily and gradually once the environment improved', 'The goal of maintaining price stability never changed, and meanwhile the unwinding of these measures has started', 'The situation in the field of fiscal policy is more complicated', 'Budget deficits in many countries across the globe have grown substantially on account of the crisis, although the euro area (in terms of the average deficit across Member States) did not by any means take the lead in this regard', 'Growing debt levels not only bring with them a potential for greater conflict between fiscal and monetary policy, but first and foremost, place a burden on the sustainability of public finances in the affected countries', 'It is, therefore, in the interests of each and every country to return to sound public finances as quickly as possible', 'In the current circumstances, where Europe faces pivotal decisions, it is more important than ever to recognise that a prosperous union requires determined action by all', 'Regarding all further decisions on the way ahead, the most important issue is that Europe’s policy-makers take and live up to their responsibility', 'This should hold not only for the European institutions – the European Parliament, the Commission and the ECB', 'It is also absolutely crucial that the governments themselves exert all their responsibilities of control and surveillance of the peers within the Eurogroup and the Council', 'I am confident that Europe will find a way to achieve this', 'Over the past 60 years, Europe has time and again succeeded in emerging from crises stronger than before', 'As I emphasised yesterday in the plenary session of the European Parliament, monetary union in Europe is far more than a monetary arrangement', 'It is a union of shared destiny', 'In order to surmount the consequences of the financial crisis, all public and private decision-makers must live up to their responsibility in their respective fields', 'For the ECB, this means continuing to fulfil its mandate – of maintaining price stability – in a fully independent and inflexible manner, for the future as it has done in the past', 'It will remain a bastion of stability and confidence, and is, therefore, on the side of the citizens', 'And, by guaranteeing price stability, it will do its clearly defined part to protect the long-term interests and future prospects of us all'])\n",

comparative advantage', 'In the paper, Pisani-Ferry and Posen try to explain the differences in policies on both sides of the Atlantic on the basis of underlying economic fundamentals and policy preferences', 'I would like to make three main observations', 'The first observation relates to the role that underlying economic conditions play in explaining policy differences', 'I would like to add one element that has not been fully explored in the analysis', 'It refers to the transmission of monetary policy in a post-bubble economy', 'In particular, the flow of credit to the private sector in the euro area seems to differ from that in the United States', 'Considering the overall amount of lending to households and non financial corporations, supplied both by the banking sector and by the capital market, there has been a recovery in the euro area in recent quarters (Chart 1)', 'In the United States, credit to households and to the corporate sector, by contrast, has been in negative territory for some time (Chart 2)', 'This might be explained by both demand and supply factors', 'As Pisani-Ferry and Posen have shown, before the crisis US households and corporates had a higher debt levels than their euro area counterparts and have had to progressively deleverage', 'On the supply side, US banks are probably also deleveraging more quickly', 'This difference in the flow of financing to the private sector partly explains the different techniques followed in the implementation of monetary policy on the two sides of the Atlantic', 'It may also explain the differences in the results achieved', 'To be sure, the ability to consistently anchor inflation expectations throughout the crisis has enabled the ECB to effectively reduce real interest rates in the euro area, as shown in Chart 3, and thus to support economic activity', 'The second point is about the lessons that central banks can learn from the past to guide their future monetary policy', 'Pisani-Ferry and Posen cite three episodes in the past which central bankers should look at carefully, namely the Great Depression, Japan’s lost decade and, more generally, previous experiences of post-financial crisis periods', 'We all certainly take a great deal of interest in, and inspiration from, these episodes', 'Looking at other post-crisis experiences, like that in Japan, some lessons can be learned', 'Let me mention three:   After a financial and housing bubble has burst (what about the primary commodities bubble', '), the growth potential is impaired, and possibly even reduced, for some time', 'According to all major international institutions, this also applies to the current period', 'Monetary policy can smoothen the transition to the new steady state, but it cannot by itself pull the economy back to the pre-crisis level, which was not in a sustainable equilibrium, within a short period of time', 'The recapitalisation and restructuring of the banking system is far more important than monetary policy in avoiding a credit crunch', 'There are, of course, other lessons to be learned from past episodes', 'But in my view, we should also look at another important period of history, the period that preceded the crisis', 'In my view, there is much more to learn from the decade that preceded the crisis than from other experiences', 'To be sure, this crisis has confronted the economics profession with the challenge of rethinking its analytical basis', 'Central banks cannot be immune from such an exercise', 'We should not be afraid of taking a critical look at the recent past', 'Let me mention seven lessons from the recent past that may be useful for the future', 'The growth recorded in advanced economies that experienced large current account deficits over the last decade was not sustainable', 'For macroeconomic policies to continue to be aimed at the attainment of similar rates of growth in the future would imply generating the same imbalances that led to the crisis', 'Very low levels of interest rates for a prolonged period of time can result in a misallocation of resources and encourage risk-taking that fuel asset price bubbles', 'There is now increasing evidence of this correlation (see Charts 4 and 5)', 'I consider it not to be fair for central bankers to shift all the blame for the build-up of the bubble before the crisis to only regulators and market participants', 'The view that monetary policy should not look at financial market conditions and should only intervene to counter the effects of the bursting of the bubble (i', 'e', 'what has been labelled the “Greenspan put”) has proved to be wrong', 'Interest rates were kept too low for too long before the crisis, mainly on account of fears that the economy would enter a Japanese-style deflation, fears that turned out to have been mistaken', 'Risk management-type monetary policy aimed at avoiding deflation is thus not without risk', 'Monetary policy cannot by itself transform a jobless recovery into a job-generating recovery', 'If anything, keeping the cost of capital excessively low may encourage capital-intensive investment, rather than labour-intensive capital expenditure', 'Core inflation is not a good predictor of headline inflation, nor of underlying inflationary pressures emerging in a global economy', 'It is very difficult to measure output gaps', 'This is not a new finding, but it tends often to be forgotten', 'Looking at the period before the crisis, what looked like as a large output gap in 2003 turned out to be a very small one a few years later', 'Therefore, it is very dangerous to calibrate monetary policy mainly on the basis of this variable (see Charts 6 and 7)', 'If we want to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, we have to keep these lessons in mind', 'This leads me to the third point I would like to make', 'It relates to the position of central banks in the institutional framework underpinning economic policy-making in our societies', 'Pisani-Ferry and Posen argue that in countries where the relationship between the central bank and the government is “unproblematic”, the central bank is freer to go beyond its usual mission, in particular with respect to the adoption of non-conventional measures', 'In fact, the institutional framework underlying the ECB does not prevent it from taking non-conventional monetary policy measures of the type that other central banks have done', 'The ECB did not embark on large-scale purchases of government bonds of Member States because it could not do so, but because we did not consider that to be an appropriate instrument in conducting monetary policy', 'The non-conventional measures we adopted relied more on the banking system, given its prominence in the transmission of monetary policy in the euro area', 'I have shown previously that our measures have been as effective, if not more effective, than others in providing liquidity to the financial system', 'Selected purchases of government bonds were used only in exceptional circumstances, to address specific problems in the transmission of monetary impulses', 'It is clear that embarking on large-scale purchases of government bonds may affect the relationship between the central bank and the fiscal authority', 'What I am not sure of is when such a relationship can be characterised as “problematic” or “unproblematic”', 'Reading the paper, I gained the impression (perhaps wrongly) that a “problematic” relationship is one in which monetary and fiscal policies are distinct, as is the case in the euro area', 'I would then like to ask: “Just where is the problem if monetary policy is kept distinct from fiscal policy, and cannot be manipulated by the fiscal authorities to solve budgetary problems', '” Perhaps it is a problem for the fiscal authorities, because they would like to use the instrument of monetary policy to inflate away the fiscal problems and have, instead, to resort to fiscal measures that are subject to parliamentary approval and that all citizens are able to judge and assess', 'It seems to me that it is not a problem for the citizens at large, especially for the less wealthy, that fiscal problems are not solved through the inflation tax or by keeping the rate of interest on public debt instruments artificially low', 'To be sure, for the European population at large, the role of the central bank should remain distinct from that of the fiscal authorities, and monetary policy should remain firmly in the hands of the central bank', 'This is why the prohibition of monetary financing of the government and the independence of the central bank have been enshrined in the Treaty', 'It is the best way to ensure that budgetary problems are addressed in a democratic way, rather than through the manipulation of the currency, which has hidden distribution effects on the population', 'In Greece, Ireland and Spain, in France and Germany, the governments are adopting budgetary policies in full awareness of the fact that they cannot count on the inflation tax to solve their fiscal challenges, challenges that all advanced societies have to face', 'Can we consider this to be a problem', 'Let me conclude on a broader issue, related to the title of the conference: Transatlantic Relationship in an Era of Growing Economic Multipolarity', 'At many of the conferences on trans-Atlantic relations that I have attended in the past, participants often discussed the decreasing relevance of these relations in the light of the new emerging global powers', 'Interestingly, when we get to discuss monetary issues, trans-Atlantic relations remain important', 'The reason is that they are the only relevant ones', 'A great deal of attention seems to be devoted to potential – and I would add, minor – differences and divergences between policies in Europe and the United States, while the rest of the world is completely forgotten', 'The paradox of major emerging market economies asking for a greater say in global governance, but at the same time shying away from responsibility in monetary matters has thus far captured little attention', 'Many important emerging market economies either do not have any monetary policy at all, because they have pegged their exchange rate to the currency of an advanced economy, or impose capital controls and restrict the international use of their own currency', 'This creates monetary divergences that are much larger in scale than those we discussed today, with global repercussions', 'Thus, rather than talking about “monetary wars”, which makes little sense, more attention should be devoted to what I would call a “monetary void” in the world economy', 'As a result of such a void, many of the problems experienced by advanced economies before the crisis, like very low levels of interest rates – especially in comparison with the underlying rate of economic growth – are now migrating to emerging markets, with potentially very critical consequences for both these economies and the global system', 'More attention needs thus to be paid to these issues, and to their consequences with respect to achieving a balanced and sustained recovery of the global economy', 'Thank you for your attention', 'Chart 1: Nominal GDP, Debt financing – EA   annual percentage changes, nsa        Source: EAA, ECB and

wenigen Jahrzehnten wäre eine einheitliche Währung in Europa für viele Beobachter undenkbar gewesen', 'Und doch feierten wir, wie Sie wissen, vor Kurzem das zehnjährige Bestehen der EZB und somit auch des ESZB, des Europäischen Systems der Zentralbanken', 'Seit der Einführung des Euro im Januar\\xa01999 konzentriert sich die EZB auf die Gewährleistung der Preisstabilität im Euroraum, ihr vorrangiges Ziel', 'Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great honour and a pleasure to be invited here today to speak about the current state of the euro area and its future', 'Not many decades ago, a single currency in Europe would have been unthinkable for many observers', 'And yet, as you know, we have just celebrated the tenth anniversary of the creation of the ECB and, for that matter, the ESCB\\xa0– the European System of Central Banks', 'Since the launch of the euro in January 1999, the ECB has focused on preserving price stability in the euro area, its primary objective', 'You all know very well that inflation rates have continued to rise since the autumn of last year', 'Inflation is expected to remain above the level consistent with price stability for longer than we previously thought', 'Last week we had to act to discourage second-round effects and to counteract the increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term', 'Our decision will contribute to delivering price stability over the medium term', 'As I will argue in my talk today, a lot depends on the solidly anchoring of inflation expectations', 'Over the last ten years, the ECB has gained a great deal of respect and credibility', 'Since the launch of the euro, the average inflation rate has been just slightly above 2%', 'And this has been achieved, despite various shocks that have hit the euro area over these years, including the ongoing strong global increase in commodity prices that is affecting Europe and the rest of the world', 'In the decades before the launch of the euro, average annual inflation rates in many EU Member States were very significantly higher', 'This is a remarkable result', 'It shows that we have inherited the credibility that was the privilege of the most successful currencies before the euro', 'Today, I would like to share with you some of our achievements over these past ten momentous years', 'They call for celebration', 'But over and beyond our performance in terms of price stability, I would also like to share with you reflections on the economic performance of the euro area and some of the remaining challenges that the ECB and the euro area as a whole face as they enter their second decade', 'I will then make a few remarks on the sound economic management of our Monetary Union', '1', 'On the achievements of the euro area    The new monetary policy framework – with the ECB setting the monetary policy for the entire euro area – was quickly understood and trusted from the very first days', 'The ECB has a clear mandate – to safeguard price stability in the euro area – and is independent', 'In 2003, the ECB clarified that price stability meant maintaining inflation rates close to and below 2% over the medium term', 'This is a clear yardstick against which the public can judge us', 'While being custodian of the trust of the citizens of the euro area, we are also fully accountable to them, and endeavour to explain our actions', 'Over these ten years, this framework has contributed to anchoring longer-term inflation expectations', 'We all know that price stability is essential for the success of a large economic and monetary union', 'It protects the incomes of all of us, and particularly those of the most vulnerable and poorest of our fellow citizens', 'An aspect that is often neglected is that, thanks to price stability, diverse other benefits follow', 'Price stability is a precondition for sustainable growth and job creation and, ultimately, social cohesion', '[1] It is also a major contribution for financial stability', 'The euro also promotes the functioning of our vast continental market and, therefore, helps bring about a true single market for goods, services, capital and labour', 'During the first nine years of the euro, 15', '7 million new jobs were created in the euro area, and the unemployment rate is now at the lowest level since the early 1980s', 'Our common currency has also helped to protect the euro area economy from diverse global shocks, as well as from the considerable turbulence of the last few years', 'Let me offer you two examples of the credibility of the ECB and the benefits that this brings', 'Over recent months, we have seen that actual inflation may temporarily diverge from our medium-term objective', 'The  first example  of the credibility of the ECB is that long-term inflation expectations have remained solidly anchored', 'In fact, they have remained well anchored over the entire ten years', 'This is remarkable considering the series of adverse economic disturbances that have hit the euro area since its inception', 'The  second example  of the credibility of the ECB is that medium and long-term market rates of the euro are at the same low levels in terms of embedded inflation expectations and risk premia as those experienced by the most stable national currencies prior to it', 'In other words, we have been instrumental in securing the lowest market interest rates on a 5, 10 up to 50-year basis', 'Most euro area countries have benefited from significantly better financing conditions than in the 1990s, a situation which has also supported fiscal consolidation', '[2]     The euro has also helped strengthen trade and financial linkages across euro area countries', 'There is clear evidence that the introduction of the single currency and the associated increase in price and cost transparency have fostered both intra and extra-euro area trade in goods and services', 'In fact, the sum of intra-euro area exports and imports increased from about 31% of GDP in 1998 to around 40% in 2007 – approximately 9 percentage points', 'During the same period, extra-euro area trade growth even exceeded that in intra-euro area trade, rising 13 percentage points from 31% to 44% of GDP in 2007', 'Hence, there is no “fortress Europe”', 'Let me also mention that, when I travel around Europe, I feel that a shift in mindset is gradually taking place', 'In fact,  firms  are becoming more conscious of the euro area dimension of their actions and decisions', 'Households  are increasingly conscious of the opportunities offered by an expanded economic and financial area', 'The launch of the euro has also coincided with a remarkable deepening of financial integration', 'The financial landscape has already changed a great deal in most market segments, and is continuing to change', 'The euro is acting as a catalyst for a gradual portfolio reallocation away from holdings of domestic financial instruments towards holdings of financial instruments issued elsewhere within the euro area', 'For instance, euro area cross-border holdings of long-term debt securities have increased strongly – from about 10% of total stocks at the end of the 1990s to nearly 60% in 2006', 'Furthermore, euro area residents almost doubled the amount of cross-border holdings of equity issued by euro area residents, from 15% to 29%, between 1997 and 2006, in particular on account of institutional investors', 'As for capital flows, the euro has boosted foreign direct investment – particularly cross-border mergers and acquisitions in manufacturing – and portfolio flows across euro area countries', 'Well-integrated financial markets and diversified portfolios reduce the extent to which the saving and spending decisions of firms and households are dependent on economic and financial developments in a specific country, region or sector', 'As a result, credit and risk-sharing channels are increasingly helping to attenuate the impact of shocks in a specific euro area country or sector', 'Let me mention also one important aspect', 'We live in an era of rapid technological progress', 'Competitive forces are reshaping global manufacturing, the financial landscape and the sharing of wealth', 'Large demographic changes are also under way', 'The impact of these “mega-trends” is very substantial, although it is difficult to quantify them precisely', 'In my view, the euro area as a whole has exhibited resilience to such external developments', 'It is, as a whole, significantly more resilient than many of its individual member countries were before the launch of the euro [3]', 'The euro area has been a source of stability', 'In short, the current state of the euro area is one of increasing interdependence and ongoing integration', 'Over these ten years, we have observed greater price stability, greater macroeconomic stability, as well as increasing economic and financial integration', 'However, despite these achievements, there is no room for complacency, and a great deal still needs to be accomplished', 'I now want to put forward the argument that several changes in this second decade and beyond will have to come from the “E” in EMU: namely that there is a need for further substantial efforts and reforms on the economic side', 'In other words, I argue that there is a need for a sound economic management', 'This has two facets', 'The first is that the overall level of economic performance in the euro area needs to improve', 'Think, for example, of the question as to how the euro area as a whole might raise its potential growth…and actually grow at such a higher level', 'The second facet is that we need to understand and address diversity of economic performance across the euro area', 'Think, for example, of the question as to the extent to which euro area countries differ in terms of economic performance', 'I will deal with these aspects in turn', '2', 'On the economic performance of the euro area    The achievements I have just described have accompanied an impressive performance in terms of job creation', 'From the start of EMU to the end of last year, as I have already mentioned, the number of people in employment in the euro area has increased by 15', '7 million, compared with an increase of only some 5 million in the previous nine years, and the euro area unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since the early 1980s', 'Of course, the surge in employment cannot be attributed solely to the euro', 'It also reflects corporate restructuring, the progress made on structural reforms and overall wage moderation in most countries', 'However, Europe is far from having exhausted its potential for further increases in labour participation rates and employment', 'Let me flag just a few facts', 'The overall employment rate in the euro area remains modest by international standards – 65', '7% in the euro area, compared with 72% in the United States – and the unemployment rate is still clearly too high – over 7% in the euro area', 'More specifically, while the employment rate of prime-age men in the euro area is comparable with that in the United States, considerable disparities remain when we look at employment rates among the young, among women and among older workers', '[4]  Labour market reforms appear to be even more appropriate if we consider that growth performance will increasingly be constrained by relatively low population growth rates and population ageing', 'Since the early 1990s, the population of the euro area has been growing at a yearly rate of only 0', '4%, compared with 1', '1% in the United States', 'Europe has room to develop its growth potential', 'Since the early 1990s, real GDP has grown, on average, by 2', '1% in the euro area, compared with 2', '8% in the United States', 'Since the start of EMU, the annual growth rate for the euro area has averaged 2', '2% per year, compared with 2', '7% in the United States', 'Even if one has to recognise that the euro area did slightly better than the US in terms of GDP growth per capita, it remains that the euro area’s potential output growth has moved to the lower bound of its previously estimated range of 2-2', '5%', 'A low trend growth in labour productivity explains, in large part, the modest growth performance', 'During the 1980s, hourly labour productivity in the euro area grew, on average, by 2', '3%, while it declined to 1', '8% in the 1990s and decreased further to 1', '2% between 1999 and 2007', 'By contrast, hourly labour productivity growth in the United States accelerated from 1', '2% to 1', '6% and then to 2', '1% over the same periods', '[5]   What can be done to enhance labour productivity', 'In recent years, we have seen rising levels of employment, particularly in the unskilled segment of the labour market', 'This has certainly contributed to the slowdown in labour productivity growth', 'However, to a large extent, there has also been a significant slowdown in total factor productivity (TFP) growth', 'TFP growth is generally taken as a measure of technological progress and improvement in the organisation and overall efficiency of production', '[6] There are many factors behind the low growth in TFP', 'Unfortunately, most European economies do not incorporate appropriate incentives to invest in real and human capital, to innovate and raise the flexibility and adaptability of firms when their environment changes', '[7]   To sum up, the remarkable labour market performance observed in the euro area since its creation could even be improved upon', 'Rising productivity must also contribute to enhancing the overall economic performance of the euro area as a whole', 'While the ECB sets monetary policy by looking at the performance of the euro area as a whole, the ECB also follows closely what happens in all euro area countries', 'In other words, we also look at diversity of economic performance across the euro area', '3', 'Diversity in EMU    Some diversity – in economic and financial developments – is a natural phenomenon in any vast currency area', '[8] Rates of economic growth, inflation and changes in labour costs can differ across countries for various reasons', 'Some of these reasons may have no link whatsoever with monetary policy or a single currency', 'For instance, diversity might originate from country-specific demographic trends or from their catching-up in terms of living standards', 'There could also be national differences in areas such as industry characteristics, investment in research and development (R&D), and innovation', 'Differences in the timing and extent of past structural reforms in euro area countries are also a source of diversity', '[9]  Differences in fiscal policies and other national policies can also give rise to diverse economic situations', 'There is an additional source of diversity due to the one-off shock constituted by the launch of the euro that may currently be working its way through the system', 'Some countries suddenly benefited from lower short and long-term interest rates, as well as from easier access to more competitive credit markets', 'This encouraged the purchase of durable and non-durable goods, as well as housing, albeit to differing extents, in the various euro area countries', 'But let’s put diversity in perspective', 'Over these ten years, the degree of diversity observed in the euro area at each point in time did not appear to be substantially different from that seen in the United States', 'Nor is it substantially different from that seen within the national borders of some large economies (such as Germany, Italy and Spain)', 'However, a distinct feature of diversity in the euro area is its persistence over long periods of time', 'In other words, diversity in most euro area countries displays significant inertia', 'Let me briefly look at three types of diversity', 'a) Inflation dispersion in the euro area declined considerably in the 1980s and 1990s and is now on a par with inflation dispersion in the United States', 'To give you an example, the unweighted standard deviation of annual HICP inflation rates still stood at around 6 percentage points in late 1990, but – since the launch of the euro – this rate has broadly stabilised at around 1 percentage point', 'This dispersion level is similar to that of the 14 US metropolitan statistical areas, but is somewhat higher than that of the four US census regions', 'Hence, impressive progress has been made, and I would argue that, prima facie, inflation dispersion in the euro area is not high by international standards', 'However, inflation differentials in the euro area are very persistent; in this respect, the euro area does indeed differ from the United States', 'Most euro area countries that have exhibited higher than average inflation rates in recent years have been in this position for at least a decade', 'These include Spain and Greece', 'Similar persistence – but on the opposite side – is observed in low-inflation countries such as Germany', 'Only in some euro area countries, such as Portugal and the Netherlands, have differentials moved from being relatively high to being in line with – or even below – the euro area average', 'Such corrections are welcome, but the point is that they are slow to materialise', 'If we look at the cost side, the factors generating inflation differentials are, in most countries, primarily domestic rather than external', 'In particular, we have witnessed sustained divergence in wage developments across the euro area and smaller differences in labour productivity growth', 'These differences in the growth of labour costs have been the main sources of persistence in inflation differentials', 'Various reasons can be suggested for this', 'Varying levels of wage rigidity across the euro area, changes in profit margins, imperfect competition and associated price rigidities across countries all affect labour costs and contribute to inflation differentials', 'If we look at product groups, price dispersion has been greater in the field of services, mostly owing to the dispersion observed in wage developments across countries', 'By contrast, inflation dispersion has been relatively low for tradable non-energy industrial goods, with greater competition in tradable goods being the main reason for this', 'Products with relatively volatile prices (such as energy and food) have, on the other hand, shown high levels of dispersion across countries in terms of price changes', 'b) Output growth differentials in the euro area have remained broadly stable since the early 1970s', 'No signs of increased annual divergence were observed between 1999 and 2007', 'The average dispersion of annual real GDP growth over this period (measured as the unweighted standard deviation) was around 2 percentage points', 'This figure is very close to the average dispersion of real growth rates since the 1980s', 'By comparison, if we look across all 50 US States, the dispersion of real growth has averaged approximately 2', '5 percentage points over the last 15 years', 'When the United States is divided into the eight statistical regions, the average dispersion shrinks to around 1', '5 percentage points', 'One issue of concern, however, is the fact that within the euro area there is also a relatively high degree of persistence regarding output growth differentials', 'This is less the case in the United States', 'However, taking the United States as a benchmark only helps up to a point', 'On the one hand, the US economy is known to be more flexible than the euro area, which means that the effects of asymmetric shocks can be absorbed more easily and more quickly', 'On the other hand, the United States exhibits stronger regional specialisation than the euro area, making its regions more susceptible to specific asymmetric shocks', 'Let me now turn to the two main drivers of growth differentials in the euro area: differentials in cycles and differentials in trends', 'Differentials in cycles have declined steadily since the early 1990s', 'There is also evidence of a stronger common euro area cycle accounting for a large part of the business cycle fluctuations across euro area countries', 'Since 1999, several shocks have spread in similar ways across euro area countries', 'For example, the euro area has successfully weathered several shocks, including the bursting of the dotcom bubble, the ripple effects of the terrorist attacks of September 11, the surge in global commodity prices – particularly energy prices – and the persistence of sizeable global imbalances', 'The high degree of synchronisation in the business cycles of euro area countries is a feature unique to the euro area', 'This suggests that EU integration and, more recently, the launch of the euro – rather than global forces\\xa0– have led to smaller differences in output gaps among euro area countries', 'The picture for the second driver of dispersion – namely differentials in trends – shows more lasting differences since the beginning of the 1990s, with a gradual increase in trend growth dispersion', 'This picture also differs across euro area countries, some of which persistently exhibit trend output growth either above or below the euro area average', 'It is here that the various sources of diversity that I have mentioned play a role', 'c) Changes in cost and price competitiveness mainly reflect changes in relative unit labour costs and persistent inflation differentials', 'These demonstrate that there is significant leeway for influencing competitiveness, even in the absence of nominal exchange rate adjustments', 'To give you an idea of the magnitude of this leeway, if we consider the cumulative growth of unit labour costs for the economy as a whole between 1999 and 2007, the difference between the countries with the largest increases and those with the smallest increases was around 20 to 30%', 'This is an important phenomenon, and a close examination of the driving factors is therefore required', 'Germany, for example, has seen moderate growth in unit labour costs over an extended period, leading to a correction of the losses in competitiveness that arose in the aftermath of German reunification', 'This correction – and the corresponding sustained period of relatively low inflation – is, of course, fully justified and most welcome', 'It also shows that adjustment mechanisms in the euro area work', 'A higher degree of wage flexibility would help to accelerate such desirable adjustment processes', 'At the other extreme, some countries may, to some extent, be catching up with others’ higher living standards', 'These countries are, therefore, possibly experiencing some temporary differences in competitiveness, reflecting movement towards a new equilibrium', 'Some other sources of persistent inflation differentials, however, might not be justifiable – for example, differentials attributable to insufficient flexibility', 'In some economies, weak labour productivity growth and strong increases in nominal wages and salaries over a sustained period inevitably result in a loss of competitiveness', 'To sum up, diversity in terms of inflation and cost developments is undesirable when it reflects structural rigidities or a lack of competition', 'While we see evidence of a stronger common euro area cycle, we also see diversity in national trend growth', 'Monetary policy has a limited role in addressing such diversity', 'Changes in competitiveness are unfolding faster than was foreseen prior to the launch of the euro, which is good in some respect because it means that necessary adjustments in relative competitiveness can be more rapid', 'But it also suggests that a lucid monitoring of competitive indicators is of the essence to avoid possible rapid losses of relative competitiveness inside the euro area', '4', 'There is thus a clear need for sound economic management in EMU    The future of the euro area will rely as much on consolidating its achievement as in meeting some future challenges', 'I will argue now that the increasing interdependence among euro area economies, combined with the need to raise the level of economic performance while addressing excessive differentials in inflation, growth and competitiveness, requires sound economic management', 'Let me now stress the importance of four guiding principles in this respect', 'a) The first principle is the rigorous implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact as a prerequisite for sound fiscal policies   There are several reasons for supporting sound fiscal policies', 'They are needed, for instance, to reduce the risk of fiscal policy spillover, both into monetary policy and, more generally, across countries', 'They are also needed to enhance flexibility and adaptability', 'Sound fiscal policies create the necessary conditions for flexibility, which cushions the effects of the economic cycle through the functioning of automatic stabilisers', 'Sound fiscal policies also ensure proper incentives', 'The tax and benefit system should avoid major distortions that affect incentives to work, save, invest and innovate, thereby making fiscal policy more efficient and growth-friendly', 'Moreover, the public sector also functions as a role model as regards, for example, wages or administrative prices', '[10] Importantly, sound fiscal policies must also make provisions for the effects of population ageing', 'b) The second principle for a sound economic management pertains to the full completion of the Single Market', 'This will enhance not only competition and efficiency, but also adjustment mechanisms in the event of adverse shocks', 'We still have significant progress to make in this domain, despite the fact that the Single Market was the goal of the founding fathers of the European Union, as set out in the Treaty of Rome, and despite the fact that this 50-year endeavour was very strongly reaffirmed with the Single European Act 20 years ago', 'According to the OECD, product market regulation remains high in several euro area countries, and the level of such regulation in the euro area as a whole is considered significantly higher than in the United States', 'Let me also mention the fact that the services sector, which represents 70% of euro area GDP, is far from being fully integrated as an effective single market', 'We attach enormous importance to the full integration of financial markets, particularly because these play a decisive role in shock absorption and adjustment dynamics in a large single currency area', 'As far as cross-border labour mobility is concerned, empirical evidence suggests that it is still low in the euro area – both across countries and within countries – on account of several formal barriers across the euro area', 'This is in clear contrast to the situation in the United States, where labour mobility is considerable and greatly contributes to the adjustment process', 'Hence, more needs to be done to enhance labour mobility in Europe', 'c) The third principle for a sound economic management is the need to closely monitor the implementation of structural reforms', 'Earlier I referred to some structural factors commonly contributing to inflation and growth differentials, as well as to disappointing growth in productivity', 'These detrimental factors include pervasive price and wage rigidities, excessive labour market regulation and the imperfect competition observed in several important sectors', 'This has been recognised for quite some time', 'It is widely acknowledged that reforms are essential in order to raise factor productivity and potential output, to create new jobs, to achieve lower prices and higher real incomes, and to increase the resilience and flexibility of the economy', 'Yet, experience to date has clearly shown how difficult it is to undertake reforms in practice', '[11] We have to persist and I shall flag some specific initiatives for reform in three main areas, namely: [12]   (1) Getting more people into work: Despite impressive achievements in job creation thus far, the still relatively high unemployment rates in the euro area (as well as the low participation rates in some countries) clearly suggest there is a need to stimulate not only labour supply but also labour demand', 'As regards labour demand, there is a need to reduce labour market rigidities as they restrict wage differentiation and flexibility, and thus tend to discourage the hiring of younger and older workers, in particular', 'Progress towards greater contractual flexibility must continue to improve in several euro area countries', 'Moreover, in those European countries where competitiveness has declined, or where the unemployment rate remains high, it is important that wage increases do not fully exhaust productivity gains', 'This in order to provide incentives for firms to create additional jobs', '[13] Finally, as regards labour supply, further reforms in income tax and benefit systems would help to increase people’s incentives to work', '(2) Increasing competition: Establishing efficient and well-functioning product and service markets can boost productivity trends by enhancing the incentive to invest and innovate, supports further employment creation, reduces inflation persistence and keeps upward price pressures contained, thereby improving the adjustment capacity of countries', '“Little else than productivity growth matters in the long-run” – as Bob Solow [14] once put it', 'It is undeniable that, over the past two decades, significant progress has already been made in the context of the Single Market Programme', 'This has already yielded major benefits for European economies', '[15] However, the extension and deepening of the Single Market still remains a high priority as regards further financial market integration, the pursuit of effective competition in the energy market and the implementation of the Services Directive', '[16]   (3) Supporting an innovative environment: The reforms that I have mentioned need to be accompanied by measures supporting innovation through higher investment in research and development and policies geared towards improving human capital', 'Europe needs many new and dynamic firms that are willing to reap the benefits of opening markets and to pursue creative or innovative ventures', 'Notably, it is new and smaller firms – rather than large ones – that are the job creators', 'This requires an entrepreneur-friendly environment with less “red tape”, and easier access to the finance these firms need', 'Europe is lagging significantly behind in this field; its venture capital financing, for instance, remains only a fraction of that in the United States, relative to the size of its economy', 'We know that research and development, as well as human capital, make valuable contributions to TFP growth', 'In 2006, R&D investment relative to GDP was only 1', '9% in the euro area, compared with 2', '7% in the United States', '[17] Cooperation between universities, public sector research institutes and industry must also intensify to raise the efficiency of public R&D spending', 'Unfortunately, in several euro area countries, investment in human capital is still too low for a “knowledge-intensive” economy', 'Instead, the employability and flexibility of the labour force requires human capital to be continuously adjusted to labour market needs', 'This investment should start “early” by enhancing the quality and efficiency of our schools and universities, and be continued through lifelong training and learning', 'd) The fourth principle for a sound economic management is the need to monitor unit labour costs and national competitiveness indicators so as to prevent or correct abnormal deviations', 'We would expect some dispersion and differentials among euro area countries', 'As I have already mentioned, in such a vast area, there will always be some diversity, as in the United States', 'Countries catching up in terms of GDP per capita and price levels are always likely to have stronger output growth and higher inflation', 'Diversity may also extend to correcting past excesses in terms of overall cost and price competitiveness, particularly in the markets for tradable goods and services', 'In such situations, national governments and social partners need to take action to address excessive wage developments and to strengthen productivity growth, so that unit labour costs in those economies increase less rapidly than the euro area average', 'To sum up, this sound economic management can foster economic stability and growth, as well as reduce the impact of adverse shocks, or facilitate the adjustment thereafter', 'The attentive monitoring of economic and financial developments, and of changes in competitiveness in particular, must be an integral part of this economic management', 'The public’s understanding and acceptance of these elements is also crucial', 'That is why we always strive to explain what actions we are undertaking, and why', '*** Ladies and gentlemen, let me now conclude', 'The past ten momentous years have been rich in achievements', 'The introduction of the euro has been recognised as a remarkable success', 'Since 1999, the single currency has fully inherited the degree of credibility and confidence that was the privilege of the most credible national currencies prior to the euro', 'Inflation expectations are well anchored, and medium and long-term interest rates in the euro area are at the same low level as the levels observed for the most credible of these former national currencies', 'We also see a remarkable degree of resilience in a complex international environment', 'These achievements are a solid foundation for our future', 'But we also know that the challenges lying ahead for the euro area are still demanding', 'What do we need to do, over the next ten years and beyond, to consolidate the remarkable success of the euro and improve the performance of euro area economies', 'We, at the ECB and the Eurosystem, must preserve the quality of our monetary policy', 'This will safeguard all the benefits expected of price stability in terms of low current and expected inflation and interest rates', 'To strengthen the “E” in EMU, we need to focus on a sound economic management and we need to secure a broad base of acceptance for it', 'This entails: a rigorous implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact; the completion of the Single Market; the implementation of the structural reforms envisaged in the Lisbon agenda; and a careful monitoring of national unit labour costs and competitiveness indicators', 'The achievements that I have described and the visible benefits of the euro support this sound economic management', 'These achievements and benefits help national governments to adapt and further liberalise their economies', 'Thank you for your attention', 'Selected references    Anderton, R', ', F', 'di Mauro and F', 'Moneta,

Several studies have shown how harmful inflation (and inflation volatility) can be', 'Let me also remind you that empirical evidence shows there is a negative relationship between inflation and output growth, with a 100-basis point permanent increase in inflation being associated with a 10 to 30-basis point decrease in trend output growth (see the May 2008 issue of the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin)', '[2] After the transition to the euro, the yield curve was fully in line with the benchmark set by the most credible currencies before EMU', 'As a result, in some euro area countries, medium and long-term market interest rates fell to unprecedented levels when the euro was introduced and have remained there since', 'This is a phenomenal benefit', 'In fact, most euro area countries have benefited from significantly better financing conditions than in the 1990s, a situation that has supported fiscal consolidation', 'For instance, in the run-up to Stage Three of EMU, fiscal deficits were reduced considerably, mainly on account of falling interest payments, from an average of 5', '2% of GDP between 1990 and 1998 to 3', '4% between 1999 and 2007 (see ECB, “10th Anniversary of the ECB”, Special Edition of the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin, June 2008)', '[3] Not so long ago, the impact of movements of the Deutsche Mark against the US dollar was often aggravated by similar movements between the currencies that have now been replaced by the euro', 'This can no longer happen', 'This increasing resilience is illustrated by the fact that the major shocks of the last ten years have not played an important role in the dispersion of output growth', 'In other words, they have not contributed to the economic diversity that I will now go on to discuss', '[4] In 2007, for instance, the female employment rate was 58% in the euro area, compared with 66% in the United States in 2006; among older workers, it was 43', '3%, compared with 61', '7% in the United States in 2006, while the youth employment rate was 38%, compared with 54', '2% in the United States in 2006', 'In the case of the euro area, these features appear to be consistent with an “insider-outsider” characterisation of the European labour market, where structural impediments resulting from the legal and regulatory environment, high taxes on labour and rigidities associated with wage regulations may prevent those groups “at the margin” from actively participating in the labour market', '[5] Euro area data on hours worked per worker in 2007 are assumed to be constant', 'US data on hours worked per worker are estimated using OECD data for 2006 and 2007', 'The source of the data is the AMECO database', '[6] According to the European Commission, total factor productivity grew, on average, by 1', '6% in the 1980s, before falling to 1', '1% in the 1990s and to 0', '7% between 1999 and 2007', 'The countries that have managed to exploit the efficiency gains resulting, in particular, from new technology have enjoyed stronger labour productivity growth', 'For instance, in the last ten years, investment in information and communication technology in the United States was double that of the euro area', 'According to the EUKLEMS database, the average contribution from ICT capital to total economic growth in the euro area was 0', '4\\xa0percentage point over the period 1995-2005, while in the United States it averaged 0', '8 percentage point over this same period', '[7] It appears that the structural characteristics of the best-performing industrialised economies, namely more flexible labour markets, greater competition in product markets and lower barriers to entry for new firms have been more receptive to the opportunities provided by new technologies', '[8] Diversity is sometimes referred to as heterogeneity or divergences: in my view, diversity might be more appropriate in most cases because a significant degree of dispersion looks like not a defect but a fundamental feature of any vast continental economy like the US or the euro area', '[9] An example of this is the Netherlands, which undertook labour market reforms far earlier than the largest euro area countries', 'This enhanced the country’s flexibility and increased its ability to adjust to a wide range of shocks', 'In other countries, short-term shocks may have had more persistent effects on growth differentials owing to slow adjustment processes caused by the presence of structural rigidities', '[10] The behaviour of the public sector can, for instance, make social partners more aware of the trade-off between higher salaries and job creation', 'Furthermore, population ageing in most industrialised economies – and a significant increase in the old-age dependency ratio and higher healthcare and long-term care expenditures will exert growing pressure on public finances', '[11] The need for structural reforms was highlighted by the Lisbon agenda of 2000, which represents a fundamental and ambitious programme to draw Europe’s attention to the major areas where changes are required', 'More recently, the Lisbon agenda has been refocused in the direction of growth and employment', 'Various attainable objectives have been set in order to enhance the flexibility and adaptability of labour markets, to raise competition in markets for goods and services, to increase employment, to promote innovation and to strengthen growth and employment rates in all participating countries', '[12] These topics are clearly reflected in the Integrated Guidelines for the new phase of the Lisbon Strategy and the recommendations for the euro area', 'We appreciate the renewed impetus toward reforms by some governments, which has now resulted in the more focused “Partnership for Growth and Jobs” and in the structural reform commitments of the national reform programmes', 'We also need to reinforce the benchmarking of good performance in order to identify with greater accuracy the areas where reform challenges are most urgent', '[13] In this context, the Governing Council considers that features that enforce wage rigidity and lead to non-optimal wage-setting, in particular, and the indexation of nominal wages to the consumer price index, should be avoided', 'This is especially relevant today, with the risk of second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on wages', 'Avoiding these practices is essential to preserve price stability in the medium term and, in turn, the purchasing power of all euro area citizens', '[14] See the introductory article of the special issue on the slowdown in productivity growth in The Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol', '2, No\\xa04, 1988,', '[15] The European Commission recently estimated that the Single Market had created 2', '75 million jobs and had brought about an increase in welfare of €518 per head in 2006, corresponding to a 2', '15% increase in EU GDP over the period 1992-2006 (see European Commission, “The single market: review of achievements”, November 2007)', '[16] Understandably, for the ECB, further European financial integration is essential given its relevance to the conduct of the single monetary policy', 'Considerable progress has already been made across various market segments', 'Financial integration is generally more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy', 'While the euro area banking markets for wholesale and capital market-related activities have shown clear signs of increasing integration since the introduction of the euro, the retail banking segment has remained more fragmented, leaving European firms and consumers unable to take full advantage of EMU and the Single Market', '[17] While many Member States expect to increase their spending in this area, the EU will fall short of its overall target of 3% of GDP by 2010', 'Increasing investment in research and development is not, of course, an objective in itself', 'If we want to see an impact on growth, it is also the return on that R&D that matters'])\n",
      " list(['Introduction    I would like to thank the European Commission for the invitation to participate in this important event', 'I am sure that all discussions today on the Commission’s Green Paper on Financial Services Policy in 2005-2010 will be highly beneficial for finalizing its thoughts on the matter, which will be reflected in the White Paper to be issued by the end of this year', 'The definition of the main priorities for financial services policy in the years to come is an important milestone in the pursuit of further financial integration', 'Although it should be recognized that financial integration in the EU has proceeded apace in recent years, in particular as a consequence of the introduction of the euro, further progress still needs to be made', 'While the objective of financial integration is inherent in the achievement of the Single Market, it is currently also extremely important in the context of the Lisbon reforms', 'Financial integration is a key factor in the development and modernisation of the financial system which, in turn, can lead to greater productivity and competitiveness, a more efficient allocation of capital and the potential for greater and more sustainable non-inflationary growth', 'For example, an empirical study by London Economics[1] estimated additional growth resulting from financial integration of the European bond and equity markets to be 1', '1% over a decade or so', 'Let me give you the views of the ECB on the proposals put forward by the Commission, noting that the Eurosystem is preparing a contribution on this subject, which will be issued shortly', 'I should underline that the interest of the Eurosystem in the pursuit of financial integration is closely related to the tasks which have been given to it by the Treaty, including the conduct of the single monetary policy, the promotion of smooth payment and settlement systems and the contribution to financial stability', 'I will start with some general considerations and then turn to some specific areas, notably financial regulation, financial supervision, and financial stability', 'General considerations    Speaking generally, let me express broad support for the key policy orientations set out in the Green Paper', 'Over the next five years, financial services policy should aim primarily at consolidating and simplifying existing Community legislation, while ensuring that the measures adopted thus far under the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP) are effectively and consistently implemented and enforced at the national level', 'Behind this broad orientation lies the shared notion that the main efforts to remove residual legal and regulatory obstacles to the free provision of financial services in the EU have been achieved with the FSAP', 'Therefore the adoption of new Community legislative initiatives should be evidence-based', 'The role of public intervention in regulating the EU financial sector remains important', 'First, developments in financial markets will always pose challenges to the existing regulatory framework that have to be considered', 'Second, the consistent and correct implementation of FSAP measures at the national level remains a challenging task for all authorities involved, notably the Commission, national governments and supervisory authorities', 'Third, the importance of the work of consolidating and simplifying the existing EU regulatory framework proposed by the Commission should not be underestimated', 'Indeed, this work represents a window of opportunity for rationalizing the existing rules applicable to financial institutions, especially those operating on a cross-border basis', 'It also involves the pursuit of synergies among the several EU public policies applicable to the financial sector, notably financial services, consumer and competition policies', 'If this process is successful, responsibility for promoting financial integration will then chiefly lie with financial institutions themselves, which should exploit the framework promoted by public authorities to expand their activity across borders', 'In this context, I would emphasise that this is also dependent on the ability of the financial industry to coordinate its members effectively whenever common initiatives are needed', 'This applies for instance in the areas of payment and securities clearing and settlement systems, where common infrastructures benefit cross-border transactions', 'In this field there is also a specific role for public authorities, notably to serve as catalysts for coordination among market participants, thus facilitating the emergence of market-led initiatives', 'One example is the role played by the Eurosystem in the promotion of the Single Euro Payments Area – SEPA – project, where the ECB, together with the European Commission, strongly supports the integration of retail payments', 'Financial regulation    Turning to the area of financial regulation, let me highlight three aspects', 'First, there is a need to proceed with the adoption of the remaining measures envisaged in the FSAP in order to complete the regulatory framework', 'In this respect, from the ECB’s perspective, the planned legislative work in the field of securities clearing and settlement is very important', 'An efficient securities clearing and settlement infrastructure is of fundamental importance for the integration and efficiency of financial markets', 'Therefore, the ECB supports the Commission’s intention to put forward a proposal for a directive on securities clearing and settlement for two reasons: a directive will help remove residual barriers – as identified by the “Giovannini Group” – to efficient EU clearing and settlement arrangements and will also provide a legal basis for securities clearing and settlement systems', 'In this context, the work which has been conducted jointly by the ESCB and the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) in setting standards on clearing and settlement systems can assist the competent authorities in their oversight and supervisory activities in this field', 'Second, with regard to possible new legislative initiatives at the Community level, we agree with the principle – put forward by the Commission – that stronger efforts should be made ex-ante to better evaluate their possible costs and benefits', 'As to the areas where such efforts could potentially be made, those identified by the Commission, notably retail financial services and asset management, certainly warrant reflection and attention', 'In the area of retail financial services, the suggested combination of targeted regulatory action and more active application of competition policy could be the way forward', 'As regards asset management, one of the main issues seems to be whether regulatory treatment at the EU level targeted specifically at the category of hedge funds is needed', 'Whereas I think it is legitimate to reflect on the pros and cons of possible regulation, I strongly believe that any regulatory response, if it proves necessary, should be taken in a coordinated manner at the international level (with particular attention to the transatlantic level), given the global nature of the hedge fund industry', 'Third, the envisaged process of consolidation of existing legislation represents an opportunity not only for rationalization but also to promote a truly common set of rules for financial institutions, especially those operating on a cross-border basis', 'This principle seems to be contained in the Commission’s proposal to launch a feasibility study on whether the relevant rules at the national and the European levels could be structured as a “financial services rulebook”', 'I support this concept: a financial services rulebook may constitute a significant contribution to reducing complexity and possible inconsistencies in the overall regulatory framework for the single financial market as well as possible legal uncertainties', 'More generally, I believe that the Lamfalussy framework contains all the elements needed to effectively pursue the objectives set out by the Commission in the area of financial regulation', 'Financial supervision    Turning to the area of financial supervision, the ECB shares the “evolutionary” approach proposed by the Commission which is based on: (i) the definition of and agreement on policy objectives; (ii) the full exploitation of the current institutional framework; and (iii) the notion that the creation of new structures should only be considered if the current set-up is deemed unable to fulfil such objectives', 'Concerning policy objectives, there is broad agreement that financial supervision should have two main aims', 'The first is to facilitate the development of cross-border finance, both in terms of financial institutions (cross-border consolidation) and products and services', 'There is clearly potential for this development', 'Let me mention a few figures with regard to the banking sector', 'The number of credit institutions in the euro area declined from around 12,000 in 1985 to 9,500 in 1995 and to 6,400 in 2004, which is mainly attributable to mergers and acquisitions (M&As)', 'These operations have mainly taken place between institutions based in the same country: between 1985 and 2005, cross-border transactions accounted for less than 20% in terms of number and value of all M&A deals in the euro area and in the EU', 'Cross-border transactions are however increasing: since the setting up of the euro, between1999 and the start of 2005, cross-border M&A operations accounted for about 30% of all deals in terms of numbers and 24% in terms of value', 'The second objective is to maintain the effectiveness of supervisory standards and action as the financial markets become more and more integrated', 'The current institutional set-up, and in particular the Lamfalussy framework, provide the appropriate infrastructure for achieving these broad policy objectives, if it is used to the maximum extent possible', 'This entails pursuing two operational goals', 'The first is the achievement of supervisory convergence by the Level 3 committees which should deliver consistent supervisory action on a cross-border basis', 'Eventually, the success of the Committee of Banking Supervisors (CEBS), CESR and the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pension Supervisors (CEIOPS) will be measured mainly on the basis of their ability to deliver effectively on the issue of supervisory convergence', 'Looking at CEBS – the committee most involved so far in the area of supervisory convergence, whereas CESR and CEIOPS have focussed more on their advisory role for draft Community legislation – the experience thus far is encouraging', 'Based on the number of consultation papers released by CEBS reflecting agreement among banking supervisors on a number of issues (e', 'g', 'validation of banks’ internal approaches, Pillar II principles and supervisory reporting), one cannot fail to note that substantive progress is being made', 'Of course, a major challenge in this field remains compliance by individual supervisors with the non-binding deliberations of the Level 3 committees', 'Transparency of implementation measures by supervisory authorities is expected to play an important role in this respect', 'The second operational goal is the deepening of the cooperation between home and host authorities for the supervision of financial groups operating across borders', 'This is an essential step for reconciling within the existing framework the interests of supervisory authorities and of the industry', 'Cross-border cooperation among supervisors should become so smooth and effective in practice as to be perceived by the industry as unified action', 'In the banking sector, the work being undertaken by CEBS in this area to develop a robust model for coordination and cooperation to be used by all supervisory authorities provides an important contribution', 'In addition to a cooperation framework, willingness on the part of supervisors to cooperate effectively on an ongoing basis is also important', 'Lack of progress on this front would fuel demands for a revision of the current institutional set-up as implicit in the notion of “lead supervisor” advocated by part of the banking industry', 'The review of the Lamfalussy approach due by the end of 2007 should represent the opportunity to form a comprehensive judgement about the effectiveness of progress made in the supervisory field and the possible way forward', 'Let me add on the subject of supervision that the ECB fully supports the planned review by the Commission of the current regime for liquidity supervision, which represents an exception to the general principle of home country control as the host authority is responsible for the liquidity supervision of a foreign branch', 'Developments in financial markets, such as centralisation of liquidity management by banks and the introduction of the euro, call perhaps for reconsideration of host country responsibility for liquidity supervision', 'The ECB intends to contribute to this work, given the interest of central banks in liquidity matters', 'Financial stability     I now turn finally to the area of financial stability', 'This remains one of the main objectives of financial services policy at the EU level', 'The interaction between financial integration and financial stability is a complex one and thus warrants close attention', 'Financial integration can provide the necessary conditions for a smoother absorption of shocks by financial institutions and offers them more options for managing and diversifying their risks', 'On the other hand, particular attention has to be given to the profound challenges to financial stability due to the structural transformation of the financial system, including intensified cross-border links', 'Therefore, effective arrangements for financial stability need to be maintained', 'I would say that significant progress has been achieved in this field over the years, particularly as a result of the activities of the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) as well as the work of the Eurosystem, with support from the ESCB Banking Supervision Committee (BSC)', 'I would just mention in this respect the EFC recommendations in the area of financial stability and crisis management and the agreements, in the form of multilateral memoranda of understanding, on cooperation in crisis situations among the central banks, banking supervisors and ministries of finance', 'Looking ahead, I see three areas where public action could focus: financial stability assessment, management of financial stress, and deposit insurance', 'First, as regards the assessment of the financial stability of the EU, the current set-up based on the EFC Financial Stability Table, mirroring the Financial Stability Forum, is certainly useful', 'The periodic discussions in the Table allow views to be formed at the EU level of the main areas of vulnerability for the financial system and the strength of its resilience to potential shocks', 'The ECB contributes to these discussions by providing the outcome of its euro area-wide financial stability monitoring, conducted with the support of the BSC and reflected in the Financial Stability Review which, since December 2004 has been made available to the public at large', 'Although the monitoring of economic risks is well developed in this context, there is room for enhancing the analysis of risks of a more structural nature and having a cross-sector dimension', 'To that end, closer collaboration between the Level 3 committees and the BSC is desirable', 'Second, as regards management of financial crises, further clarification of the arrangements for effective cooperation among the relevant authorities is a major priority', 'For instance, the BSC and the CEBS are jointly developing proposals for further enhancing cooperation between central banks and banking supervisors, particularly in terms of identifying best practices for handling financial crises and building up operational network mechanisms', 'Furthermore, the Green Paper refers to emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) as an area where a review would be undertaken by all the relevant parties', 'I would like to note that the provision of ELA is a central bank function and an agreement exists within the Eurosystem on how this facility operates in the euro area', 'It is my perception that there are no specific issues relating to the provision of ELA which need to be addressed at the EU level', 'Third, as regards deposit insurance, which is an important component of the financial safety net, the ECB supports the initiative of the Commission to review the existing Deposit Guarantee Directive to ascertain whether greater convergence of national schemes is desirable from the perspective of both financial integration and financial stability', 'The main areas of this review appear to be the reduction of national differences, which may become particularly relevant in the case of cross-border banking, and the pursuit of formal cooperation between the different national schemes', '* * * Let me conclude by underlining once again the broad support for the key orientations put forward in the Green Paper and by thanking the Commission for its close and transparent cooperation with all interested parties during the process', '[1] London Economics (2002), “Quantification of the macro-economic impact of integration of EU financial markets”, Report to the European Commission'])]\n",
